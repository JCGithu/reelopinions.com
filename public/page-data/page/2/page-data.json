I thought you could use them” replies producer Alexander Aja.\n“Why?”\n“So that people can see.”\n“I’m not following.”\n“Never mind.”\n\n\nDirector Grégory Levasseur isn’t in the mood to argue over mere technicalities,\nhe had bigger concerns on his mind, whether or not his audience could see\nANYTHING AT ALL ON SCREEN didn’t matter. They’d got through it so far without\nworrying about it. No. His mind was elsewhere. For a start, he’s on the final\nday of shooting and has yet to acquire a script. So far he and the crew have\nbeen working with some crayon jottings they found on a napkin at a Burger King.\n“It’ll do” he shrugged when setting up the camera on day one, and it had been\nthe production ethos ever since. But maybe now was the time to make a change.\nDialogue such as “We’re like food in a bowl” and “Can you stop being\nArchaeologists for 5 minutes and act like human beings!?” can only get you so\nfar.\n\nHe mulls on this thought. Plays with it, loses himself in it. Then out of the\nperpetual dessert  ahead the assistant director approaches, asks him why\n they’re doing a wide shot featuring all of the cast in this found footage\nmovie. Oh damn, found footage, he had forgot. Had he made this error more than\nonce? Days were starting to blur together, nothing was certain anymore. The A.D\nasks if this means they’ll have to get rid of that shot where the camera tracks\nup into space and looks down on earth. So he had forgotten before. Oh well.\n\n“Are you kidding? That’ll take… effort”.\n\nNo. He has more pressing matters to attend to. The visual effects people are on\nthe phone asking if he really wants his monsters to look like the rabbit\ncreatures from the 2002 Scooby Doo movie. Amateurs. Why can’t they understand\nhis dream? Out here, a man has to come to terms with who he really is. Who is\nLevasseur? A visionary. They might not see that now. But they will. They will.\nHe looks up to the sky. There are no clouds. Just the vast expanse of infinite\nspace. No one to tell them what to do. Here everything plays by his rules. He\nreturns his gaze down, walks onto set.\n\nLet’s just get this over with. The heat is baring down too hard. Overwhelmed by\nthe stress of the job, the pressure, it’s all too much. One final push. Then\nhome.\n\n“And action!” His mouth makes the sound, but his mind doesn’t comprehend the\nwords. Then it begins. Indistinct noises. Confused inept actors running around\nin the dark. He doesn’t listen. Everything around him is a blur. Eventually the\nmurmuring stops.\n\n“CUT!”\n\n“That’s a wrap.”\n\nSighs of relief. People talk at him. Pay cheques are taken. Flights home are\nboarded. A trailer is cut. Distribution. Exhibition. Ticket’s purchased.\nProjection. Cinema dies a little.\n\nThe Uttermost ends of the earth flow sombre under an overcast sky.

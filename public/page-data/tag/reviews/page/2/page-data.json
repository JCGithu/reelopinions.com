It was as if the\ndevelopers had a pathological compulsion to please and were therefore willing to\nsay anything in order to keep their fanbase happy.\n\n\nIndeed, IIIFonic forecast- amongst other things- new playable characters, the\nability to weapon swap, various balancing tweaks, Jason X content, and a revised\npunishment for rage quitters (more on that later). Oh, and they also vowed to\nfinally introduce dedicated servers, along with a proper single-player mode as\nwell.\n\nThis ambition cannot be faulted and it’s abundantly clear that the developers\nreally do care about their product. In fact, their tendency to over-hype things\nis of the more affable, Peter Molyneux variety, in the sense that it stems from\nmisguided passion and blind optimism, rather than conscious deception. Having\nsaid that, they have still dug themselves into a bit of hole. Earnest intent\naside, they are selling a product, which means that they should appropriately\nmanage expectations, instead of stoke them up to 11.\n\nAfter all, because of the team’s inability to simply stop announcing things,\nthere is now a massive anticipation associated with the new patch. It certainty\nhas an an awful lot to deliver on, perhaps too much, because as it stands, there\nare certain things conspicuously missing here (most notably: those dedicated\nservers!). Moreover, the content that has been included is far from refined.\n\nWhilst the minor improvements- i.e.balancing adjustments; revamped animations\nand cosmetic upgrades- are all fine, the meatier additions leave something to be\ndesired.\n\nIntroducing the Single-Player Challenges\n\n\nIn particular, the new single-player mode is a complete mess. Which is a shame,\ngiven that A) its absence has long been a sticking point for many critics and B)\nthe gameplay foundations are perfectly solid. Alas, as is becoming a recurring\ntheme with Friday the 13th, whilst everything is fantastic on paper, the\ntechnical execution is disappointingly lacking.\n\nThe new mode is kind of reminiscent of a bargain-basement Hitman, in which you\ntake control of Jason and are tasked with picking off a group of typically\namorous teens in either stealthy or creative ways. In total, there’s only 10\nmissions to sink your teeth into, but to incentivise further replay the\ndevelopers have included a litany of extra trials, some of which are mutually\nexclusive. This means that completionists will have to do the whole thing\nmultiple times if they want to 100% it.\n\nEach map has 3 standard ”skulls”: one for ensuring that there are no survivors;\none for doing so whilst remaining undetected, and one for meeting an arbitrary\nscore target. Meanwhile, there are also bespoke objectives tailored to each\nlevel, ranging from ”murder the designated teen in a specific way”, to ”ensure\nthat no one reaches an allocated landmark”. As aforementioned, you can’t always\ndo these things simultaneously, or even in a clean attempt. Therefore if you\nwant to meet all of the requirements in a given scenario, you’ll need to\nre-experience it several times.\n\nThe Good Bits\n\n\nOn the surface, these missions could be fun, given that they are building upon\ntried-and-tested mechanics for an entirely new experience. This should make for\na nice change of pace from the multiplayer, as you get far more opportunity to\nbe tactical with your approach.  You’re not working against the clock to hunt\ndown knowing victims anymore, instead you’re dealing with unsuspecting cattle in\nmuch more contained venues. This means that you’re no longer playing an\nexpansive game of hide-and-seek and thus have greater scope to experiment and\nplay around.\n\nThere’s plenty of fan-service thrown into the mix as well, with scenes\nfastidiously recreated from the films. There’s a meticulous attention to detail\nin the environments, dialogue is lifted directly from the source material and\nclassic kills are replicated in all their outlandish glory. Being able to homage\nthe entire climax of The Final Chapter, or pull off the famous speargun kill\nfrom Friday the 13th: Part 3, is doubtlessly going to thrill any devotee of the\nfranchise.\n\nSpeaking of which, the plethora of new fatalities is easily the highlight of\nthis particular offering. Figuring out where they are and how to execute them is\na real treat, and you can tell that the devious think tank over at IIIFonic had\na blast devising them.\n\nAt its best, the new campaign successfully taps into the sinister, power fantasy\nappeal of Friday the 13th. Role-playing as an unstoppable killing machine,\nstalking your would-be victims from the shadows and then perfectly executing\nyour fiendish plan is an exhilarating process.\n\nOr at least that’s true at the beginning, but the fun rapidly dissipates.\n\nThe Negatives\n\nAs with the earlier iterations of Friday’s multiplayer, the novelty of this solo\nexperience is quickly undermined by just how frustrating, janky and\nfundamentally broken it is. The performance is wildly unstable, the AI behaviour\nis erratic and difficult-to-gauge and glitches are ludicrously rampant, along\nwith persistent frame-rate drops and recurring crashes. Even the controls have\nsomehow been botched, despite the fact that they’re identical to the existing\nones. In particular, the interact button proves to be a fickle mistress, often\nneglecting to carry out its duties, presumably out of sheer contempt for the\nplayer.\n\nWhen all of these problems converge – and they regularly do – then you’re\neffectively presented with a Kobayashi Maru situation, i.e: a true no-win\nscenario. The game insists that you are at fault, either because someone got\naway or because you were spotted. But make no mistake, you didn’t fail it. It \nfailed you.\n\nYou’re not to blame if the command prompts aren’t responding, or if a door\nrefuses to open. Nor can you help it if a counsellor never arrives because they\ngot stuck on a rock. Likewise, if divine Providence has intervened to save Chad\nby teleporting him halfway across the fucking map, then that shouldn’t reflect\nbadly on you. The game did not uphold its end of the bargain. It ceased to\nfunction and it will do so many, many times.\n\nThis wouldn’t be so grating, were it not for the fact that every single time you\nrestart a level, you are forced to endure the exact same, unskippable cut scene.\nAs a result, if you are having a notably tough time with a challenge (or if the\ngame unaccountably freezes on you) then you’ll have to endure the opening\ncut-scene on an endless loop and it wont be long before you’re capable of\nreciting the dialogue in its entirety.\n\nFor instance, take this little exchange from Chapter 10:\n\n> Tiffany: Mind if I dance with him?\nVanessa: Actually, I’m gonna take a swim. Something stinks in here.\nTiffany: Hey big stuff, show me your moves?\nKenny: Sure Milady.\n\nTo clarify, I didn’t have to look that up. This scene has been committed to\nmemory, etched onto the very matter of my brain, after only a single play\nsession. That would be excruciating enough if it was my fault, but\nmore-often-than-not the restart happened when the game just shit itself and\ndecided to punish me for it!\n\nWhat’s even worse is that sometimes these openings (which I have to stress are \nunskippable) don’t even play properly. On both the PS4 and Xbox One versions,\nthere is a specific intro that has a good chance of crashing the game and it was\nnot uncommon for me to see clones of NPCs materialise in the middle of a\ncut-scene.\n\nAnd as for the defective AI, that’s possibly the biggest ball-ache of all. They\ncan’t seem to decide if they’re working to a preordained path, or if they’re\ninstead improvising their behaviour. I think it’s supposed to be the former, but\nit doesn’t always work like that, as if we’re in Westworld or something and the\ncharacters are rebelling against their narrative.\n\n\nThis is highly disruptive to the gameplay, because achieving the perfect\nstealth-run requires you to know exactly where the NPCs go to isolate themselves\nand exactly when they do it. Everything needs to be in precise synchronicity for\nthis, otherwise all your planning goes down the drain. Even a split second going\namiss can make the difference between a kill and a missed opportunity, or\nbetween a character facing one direction and them facing another, so they need\nto be regimented!\n\nAdmittedly, there are many stealth games out there that use unscripted AI and\ndon’t have things like designated patrol routes (Metal Gear Solid V, Alien\nIsolation). In those games, you obviously can’t rely on set patterns and have to\nadapt to situations as they unfold. However if that’s the case, then the level\ndesign should properly account for this off-the-cuff dynamic.\n\nYet that’s not how it works in Friday the 13th, and so you can never be certain\nhow to proceed.  You can’t predict if the AI will suddenly verge from the path\nthat it has invariably taken in every other instance. Sure, Eric is programmed\nto go outside after he’s been rejected by Tiffany, but the one time that you\nprepare for him doing this will be the one time that he inexplicably remains\ninside.\n\nHell, the NPC behaviour is so volatile that on one occasion a wheelchair-bound\ncharacter miraculously recovered and went for a fucking moonlight stroll!\n\nAnd the bloody Salt Mines\n\n\nThose single-player challenges might be blatantly unfinished, but at least you\ncan ignore them and it wont have much of an impact on the rest of the game. The\n”Salt Mines [http://www.f13game.com/news/welcome-to-the-salt-mines/]” on the\nother hand, are a much more dangerous proposition. Conceived as a deterrent to\nrage-quitters, this new system threatens to segregate any players who are deemed\nto be ”salty” by IIIFonic. In other words, it’s a method of shaming those who\nostensibly have a history of poor sportsmanship.\n\nAgain, this is theoretically viable and anywhere else it would be a welcome\nsolution to the problem of sore losers. But in a game as notoriously unreliable\nas Friday the 13th, it’s rather galling that they have the nerve to introduce\nthis. Yes, people are guilty of quitting matches early and I have no shame in\nadmitting to it myself. Why? Because the game practically dares me to.\n\nWhen the lag becomes unbearable, when cheaters are exploiting glaringly\nunaddressed bugs and when my character freezes in the middle of an animation\n(and thus become useless), then of course I’m going to quit. As a working adult\nwith real-life commitments, I don’t have the time to simply power through these\nbadly performing matches. I’m only going to stick around for the ones that work.\n\nFor the game to brand me as a ”salty”, simply because I refuse to put up with\nits shit, is just a step too far in my book. If a car habitually stalled every\ntime you tried to change gear, you wouldn’t grin and bear it. You’d get a new\ncar. And you wouldn’t expect the manufacturer to come out publicaly and\ncriticise your driving ability like a bunch of knobheads.\n\nSo, before you start condescending me about how’ ‘losing is a part of playing’,\nwhy don’t you get your product into an acceptable state first? Because until\nit’s fixed, I am going to continue leaving broken matches. And the day that I am\nsent to the salt mines for that crime, will be the day that I stop giving this\nmess a chance and put it away for good.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Free cosmetic additions, balancing tweaks and a new playable counsellor.\n+ Inventive deaths and references are enjoyable. \n+ Single Player Challenges are fun initally.\n\nCons:\n\n– Still no dedicated servers\n– Single Player feels rushed and annoying\n– Unskippable, recurring cut-scenes\n– Salt Mines are just a bad idea\n\nRating: 5/10","html":"<p>It’s only been a few months since the <a href=\"https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/02/video-game-review-friday-13th-game-january-update/\">last update</a> to <strong>Friday the 13th: The Game,</strong> but in that short space of time, the combined teams over at Gun Media and IIIFonic have been furiously making announcements, pledging new features at an absolutely manic rate.<br><br>They arguably got a little over-eager in this regard, with a level of promise-making seldom observed outside of national politics.

There's only a few\nquestions just because we had limited time and there was translation back and\nforth. But yeah, give it a read if you're interested in more.\n\nMary the Witch's Flower is the first film by Studio Ponoc; meaning \"midnight\" or\n\"a brand new day\" as a majority are staff that have left Studio Ghibli to start\ntheir own company. Yonebayashi, the director, he originally did ‘When Marnie Was\nThere’ and ‘The Secret Life of Arietty’, and basically when Studio Ghibli\nstarted shutting now and it’s masters announced they were no longer producing\nfeature films, its younger staff thought: \"Well... We still want to do stuff.\nWe'd like to have jobs\" and so they have set off on their own ways.\n\nThere is a quote from the original book that they cited a lot in a lot of the\ninterview materials  where Mary says at one point: \"I want to open this door but\nI want to open it without using magic no matter how long that takes\" and that is\nkind of how they've cited their mindset going into this film. They wanted a\ncharacter that liked magic, but then realized at the end of it that they no\nlonger needed magic to be who they were. That is the context that they've seen\nfor moving on from the magic of Studio Ghibli.\n\nI understand that concept, however I think that they don't push far enough with\nthis film to be completely separate from the past.\n\nI also think there's something with that statement where you say \"We don't want\nmagic\" – as it’s disregarding that that is the aspect most people like about\nStudio Ghibli? They like that it's got this magical element to it, this fantasy,\nthis wonder, and saying we want to leave the magic of Studio Ghibili behind -- I\nknow that they're  highlighting its reputation moreso than the actual style of\nthe films, because this is very much a continuation of that. But it's a\ntouchstone that I think highlights a few of the flaws going into the final\nproduct.\n\nMary and the Witch's Flower is based on the English novel The Little Broomstick.\nMary has moved to live with her elderly aunt in the countryside and it's summer\nso she's just waiting to start school in this new area. So she's left in the\nhouse with just elderly people and nothing to really do and so she's very bored\nand she slowly starts exploring the nearby countryside. While doing that she\nfollows some cats finds the magical witch's flower and a broomstick. By crushing\none of the flower’s berries she gains magical powers for those 24 hours and the\nbroom sets off and takes her away to Endor College where she finds a magical\nheadmistress and plots happens, as it tends to do sometimes.\n\nAs films go it's not particularly flawed in any way, it's just missing that\nmagic that they wanted to kind of step away from. Mary feels like a compilation\nof all the kind of stubborn Ghibili girls rolled into one, but with nothing in\nparticular defining her. It's also a very similar plot of being whisked away to\na magical building run by a kind of creepy crony old woman who uses magic to\ncontrol the girl at several times and it ultimately wraps into a story of\nTechnology versus nature. So to say this is a film that is entirely branching\nout from what's happened before would be… untruthful.\n\nThey have also said in all the promotional materials that they didn't\ndeliberately go out to try and make a film that would be popular and make money\n- they wanted to make something that they wanted to make; and again I think, is\nthat really true? Because, granted, the director’s previous two books that he's\nadapted into films are English fantasy novels by female writers around the same\nera, So that's definitely in his MO, but the past two films were definitely\nsmaller in scale and a lot more focused on human drama and emotions. Whereas\nthis is on a much larger scale and just seems to skim over a lot of the human\nelement of the film.\n\nAs you could probably see in the trailer obviously the animation is just\ntop-notch all the way through. I think they've put a majority of the kind of\nflourishes in the trailer so you've probably already seen it on this video but\nthere are some really amazingly animated sections.\n\nI don't know why I've left off this review so long because I saw it a while ago\nand when I think back to it I just think that there wasn't that much to remember\nabout it. Like I said the characters were kind of cut-out, the plot was... I\nwouldn't venture to say predictable but it wasn't particularly imaginative and\nthe moments where the film was being imaginative it seemed to really brush over\nto get back to a plot that I wasn't that interested in. In all of the interviews\nthey mentioned how passionate they were about this project and I'd watched the\nbehind-the-scenes documentary on the amount of work that they did put into it\nand the amount of late nights - but watching the final film you don't feel that.\nYou don't feel the passion.\n\nYou don't feel like this is a story that he really wants to tell. It feels like\nthe story that the studio wants to tell to get a really good first start and I\ncan understand that because starting a studio, especially a high quality\nanimation feature film studio, is just--  it's a very very risky move. It just\nis. I'm not saying that they don't love animation, obviously they love animation\nthat's why they are wanting to make this, but they need to set a good foundation\nfor that company and I completely understand that but I just think that it means\nthat whatever Ponoc come out with next potentially, or maybe the film after\nthat, if they continue to be successful I just think that this will be looked\nback on as the safe foundation from which they tried to build something new.\n\nI can't hate the film for that. But it doesn't mean I have to love it or\nparticularly like it. I don't think there was much to watch back on. I think\nthat if you maybe have a kid, they might enjoy it. Just a kid that loves fantasy\nin particular But for adults--  like adults can re-watch a lot of the classic\nGhibili films and still feel that wonder of it and the fun. Personally I just\ndon't think there was enough of that here to really get me excited about it.","html":"<p>Before I get to the proper review I just wanted to say that there is an interview with the director and the producer of Mary and the Witches Flower up on our website that will be linked in the description.

That is the context that they've seen for moving on from the magic of Studio Ghibli.<br><br>I understand that concept, however I think that they don't push far enough with this film to be completely separate from the past.<br><br>I also think there's something with that statement where you say \"We don't want magic\" – as it’s disregarding that that is the aspect most people like about Studio Ghibli? They like that it's got this magical element to it, this fantasy, this wonder, and saying we want to leave the magic of Studio Ghibili behind -- I know that they're  highlighting its reputation moreso than the actual style of the films, because this is very much a continuation of that. But it's a touchstone that I think highlights a few of the flaws going into the final product.<br><br>Mary and the Witch's Flower is based on the English novel The Little Broomstick. Mary has moved to live with her elderly aunt in the countryside and it's summer so she's just waiting to start school in this new area. So she's left in the house with just elderly people and nothing to really do and so she's very bored and she slowly starts exploring the nearby countryside. While doing that she follows some cats finds the magical witch's flower and a broomstick. By crushing one of the flower’s berries she gains magical powers for those 24 hours and the broom sets off and takes her away to Endor College where she finds a magical headmistress and plots happens, as it tends to do sometimes.<br><br>As films go it's not particularly flawed in any way, it's just missing that magic that they wanted to kind of step away from. Mary feels like a compilation of all the kind of stubborn Ghibili girls rolled into one, but with nothing in particular defining her. It's also a very similar plot of being whisked away to a magical building run by a kind of creepy crony old woman who uses magic to control the girl at several times and it ultimately wraps into a story of Technology versus nature. So to say this is a film that is entirely branching out from what's happened before would be… untruthful.<br><br>They have also said in all the promotional materials that they didn't deliberately go out to try and make a film that would be popular and make money - they wanted to make something that they wanted to make; and again I think, is that really true? Because, granted, the director’s previous two books that he's adapted into films are English fantasy novels by female writers around the same era, So that's definitely in his MO, but the past two films were definitely smaller in scale and a lot more focused on human drama and emotions. Whereas this is on a much larger scale and just seems to skim over a lot of the human element of the film.<br><br>As you could probably see in the trailer obviously the animation is just top-notch all the way through. I think they've put a majority of the kind of flourishes in the trailer so you've probably already seen it on this video but there are some really amazingly animated sections.<br><br>I don't know why I've left off this review so long because I saw it a while ago and when I think back to it I just think that there wasn't that much to remember about it. Like I said the characters were kind of cut-out, the plot was... I wouldn't venture to say predictable but it wasn't particularly imaginative and the moments where the film was being imaginative it seemed to really brush over to get back to a plot that I wasn't that interested in. In all of the interviews they mentioned how passionate they were about this project and I'd watched the behind-the-scenes documentary on the amount of work that they did put into it and the amount of late nights - but watching the final film you don't feel that. You don't feel the passion.<br><br>You don't feel like this is a story that he really wants to tell. It feels like the story that the studio wants to tell to get a really good first start and I can understand that because starting a studio, especially a high quality animation feature film studio, is just--  it's a very very risky move. It just is. I'm not saying that they don't love animation, obviously they love animation that's why they are wanting to make this, but they need to set a good foundation for that company and I completely understand that but I just think that it means that whatever Ponoc come out with next potentially, or maybe the film after that, if they continue to be successful I just think that this will be looked back on as the safe foundation from which they tried to build something new.<br><br>I can't hate the film for that. But it doesn't mean I have to love it or particularly like it. I don't think there was much to watch back on. I think that if you maybe have a kid, they might enjoy it. Just a kid that loves fantasy in particular But for adults--  like adults can re-watch a lot of the classic Ghibili films and still feel that wonder of it and the fun. Personally I just don't think there was enough of that here to really get me excited about it.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWZmdCA47Z0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-mary-witches-flower/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"e4d9928b-809d-4d3d-9e02-5f6cc8118038","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60292d39948a20001c2046a6","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__6035520624de3c001c23ac77","title":"Review | A Quiet Place","slug":"review-a-quiet-place","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/quiet-place.jpg","excerpt":"While A Quiet Place manages to captivate with it's intriguing concept, it ultimately comes across as slightly toothless.","custom_excerpt":"While A Quiet Place manages to captivate with it's intriguing concept, it ultimately comes across as slightly toothless.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"23 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"02 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"23 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-23T19:05:42.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-05-02T19:06:00.000+01:00","updated_at":"2021-02-23T19:07:29.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harrison Abbott","slug":"harrisonabbot","bio":"Opinionated, Verbose and Generally Pedantic.

It's a big one. It's Avengers Infinity War\nwhich comes out I suppose 36 hours from when this comes out I think, and it's\ngood. It's genuinely really good. It already says in the title of the video but\njust to clarify, definitely no spoilers are here. Not even vaguely spoiler\nstuff, I just want to keep focusing on... not necessarily vague points but\nnonspecific.\n\nI'm going to be splitting up this review kind of into two parts. One focusing on\nthe experience of the film and the other being the film itself which will make\nsense when I get onto it. If you were just a big Marvel fan and you're going\nthrough the reviews on YouTube trying to find if you should believe the hype or\nnot then I would say, one, listen just to the first half of this video, and two,\nyes I would say so. Which is rare for me because I don't think I've said that\nfor a Marvel film for a long time. Possibly not since the first Avengers.\n\nThe reason I'm going to be breaking up the review into two parts is that as a\nfilm I think it's great but has a few flaws but as like a movie cinematic event\nI think that it is the most effective it's being in a long long time and I think\nthat even for myself, not a super fan of the series, I found myself honestly\ncaptivated and enthralled as to what was going to come next. Even staying away\nfrom fan theories you hear the fan theories and I think one very important point\nto make is that it surprised me which is not something a Marvel film has done in\na long time. It genuinely surprised me, there were moments where I couldn't\nbelieve that they made those choices. Perhaps more because I kind of view it so\nmuch as a (in context) as a very safe series so maybe that led into me being\nmuch more surprised. But I think that just leads into my ongoing point that I\nthink fans are definitely going to get exactly what they were hoping for with\nthis film. I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe comedy is an improvement still on civil war and becomes much more hit than\nmiss it is still hit and miss for me but much more hit this time. All of the\nmatchups I think with characters meeting each other for the first time, I think\nthat they play off each other very well in almost every single scene - and\ncoming into that the creative way which the Russos dealt with the fight\nchoreography in Civil War definitely continues with this. Constantly trying to\nfind new ways to just make these superheroes combine and find new interesting\nways to try and make their powers fun to watch. I'm just so surprised that I\nthink that they did manage to live up to the expectations of everything that's\nbeen set up to this film. I think there could be some controversial decisions\nthat maybe some fans don't enjoy but I don't think any fan could say that they\ndidn't deliver on the premise of this film. As a cinema experience I would say\nthat it was the one of the most enjoyable I've had in a long time, genuinely,\nand again coming not as a complete super fan of the series.\n\nNow is the part of the video where I'll jump into some of the flaws that I found\nwith it - so if you just wanted to hear the full positive stuff maybe tune out\nnow. I'm not ripping into it or anything just that it's small aspects where I\nwasn't necessarily disappointed but I thought it could be improved upon and\ncertain story beats that I think could be if anything just cut or changed. Again\nwith being vague and spoiler free.\n\nFirstly is the cinematography which, considering the amount that they poured\ninto this film does not I think look as impressive as they hoped and I find that\nthe ways in which the Russos put the camera I find actually takes away sometimes\nfrom what's happening on screen. I don't think that they portray action in the\nbest way that they possibly could. However, I will say that every time they have\na creative idea involving shots then that's pulled off very well, surprisingly,\nso it's a weird mixture where I think when the moments where it counts I think\nthey pull off some really great visual moments, but in a lot of the hand-to-hand\ncombat and less important moments in this film I think that the camerawork feels\nlike sloppy and almost unclear at points. Not to a point where it's completely\ndetrimental to the film, but parts where I just thought it didn't feel like it\nwas tightly made. Maybe they are going for slightly more off-the-cuff aspect to\nit, to try and give a kind of more realistic feel to everything, but I think\nthey just kind of came off as – when you're doing it in such a massive CGI world\nfor a lot of the film it doesn't come off that way, it comes off as kind of easy\ncamerawork and I think it shows off a lot of how they are directors that have\ncome from TV.\n\nAnother middling point is that sometimes I think some of the initial\ninteractions between the characters I think happened very quickly just because\nwant to get this show on the road. This doesn't feel like a long film but this\nis a long film they have a lot to get through and so I can understand that\nsometimes they need to rush through some introductions but I think like, for\ninstance, some of the characters meeting aliens for the first time that seemed\nto be very brushed under the rug and just kind of \"Let's go. Keep up the pace.\nWe got to keep going.\" From the moment the film starts it never really stops\ngoing the whole film and I find it admirable but yeah I just think there were\ncertain parts that were brushed under the rug a bit too much to get on with the\naction. There's only one newly established character in this film which is Peter\nDinklage and I thought his character was stupid. I didn't take it seriously the\nwhole time he was on screen and I know you could say that this was a film where\nyou're not meant to take everything completely seriously but it was just a silly\ncharacter.\n\nI'm genuinely amazed for some of the story points that they went with in the\nend. Oh, and the story points thing that I wanted to touch on is just that I\nbriefly said about fan theories earlier and I think that that has kind of come\ninto play into the script. I've talked a lot in recent reviews about how the\nidea that fans reactions to things, because of internet culture, I think media\nis becoming a lot more reactionary to fans responses for things and I think\ncertain scenes in this play into that a tiny bit. Not so necessarily much in a\nfanservice way but just in a way that it's clearly playing off fans expectations\nand again for those scenes.\n\nI think that they could have been played differently or to be honest scrapped in\norder of more character building moments as opposed to setting up more questions\njust for the sake of more questions.\n\nAgain, I'm trying to stay vague but if someone watches the film and then comes\nback to this review I think that they might pretty easily put what scenes I'm\ntrying to explain. It was genuinely impressive film, a really fun experience in\nthe cinema, and while I don't think it will be like my favourite film of the\nyear or anything like that I think that this goes to show it's just if anything\nit proves it as a big experiment that I think has paid off and I think that is\nultimately going to cement it in a lot of fans hearts as like a true favorite\nseries now.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PebXG6oLsgw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p><strong>Transcript</strong><br><br>Hi and welcome back to Reel Opinions.

It is his second\ncrack at stop motion animation but this is a marked improvement on Fantastic Mr\nFox.\n\nYou feel that Anderson wouldn’t have got back to stop motion unless he felt he\nhad a great story to tell, and that’s true of this film. It’s a dog-based caper\nand is perhaps one of Anderson’s most fun and enjoyable movies to date.\n\nI saw this in a cinema full of kids during the Easter holidays but I think it’s\nfair to say that this isn’t really a film for children despite the PG rating.\nThere’s the usual sense of melancholy which doesn’t really chime for younger\nviewers but I think anyone can enjoy the incredibly detailed animation so\nperhaps I'm not the right person to say that.\n\nAnd that is a great point to start on. The level of detail and thought that has\ngone into every frame is incredible. The Isle of Dogs is an abandoned island\nupon which all of the dogs in the fictional city of Megasaki are banished after\nan epidemic of dog flu breaks out. There are two narratives at play; one is a\nyoung boy's desire to find his pet dog which was sent to the island and the\nother is of the dog's desire to flee the island and overcome the dog flu. The\nsettings are divided between this island and Megasaki city. The island is a\nplace in decay, abandoned by humans and now serving as little more than a\nrubbish dump. The beautifully detailed mise-en-scene makes this animated world\nfeel real and genuinely inhospitable. The city seems vast and densly populated\nand demostrates extensive research into Japanese culture and architecture. A\ncouple of scenes which demonstrate this are one in which sushi is prepared and\nanother where a kidney is transplated. It sounds completely inane but it is\nhonestly staggering.

It is his second crack at stop motion animation but this is a marked improvement on Fantastic Mr Fox.<br><br>You feel that Anderson wouldn’t have got back to stop motion unless he felt he had a great story to tell, and that’s true of this film. It’s a dog-based caper and is perhaps one of Anderson’s most fun and enjoyable movies to date.<br><br>I saw this in a cinema full of kids during the Easter holidays but I think it’s fair to say that this isn’t really a film for children despite the PG rating. There’s the usual sense of melancholy which doesn’t really chime for younger viewers but I think anyone can enjoy the incredibly detailed animation so perhaps I'm not the right person to say that.<br><br>And that is a great point to start on. The level of detail and thought that has gone into every frame is incredible. The Isle of Dogs is an abandoned island upon which all of the dogs in the fictional city of Megasaki are banished after an epidemic of dog flu breaks out. There are two narratives at play; one is a young boy's desire to find his pet dog which was sent to the island and the other is of the dog's desire to flee the island and overcome the dog flu. The settings are divided between this island and Megasaki city. The island is a place in decay, abandoned by humans and now serving as little more than a rubbish dump. The beautifully detailed mise-en-scene makes this animated world feel real and genuinely inhospitable. The city seems vast and densly populated and demostrates extensive research into Japanese culture and architecture. A couple of scenes which demonstrate this are one in which sushi is prepared and another where a kidney is transplated. It sounds completely inane but it is honestly staggering. It's probably the most I have been in awe of something in a film for some time.<br><br>You might be concerned by the fact that all of the human characters speak Japanese in the film without any subtitles.

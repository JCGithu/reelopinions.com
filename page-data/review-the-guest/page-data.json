Occasionally though,\nsomething good does manage to slip through the cracks, The Cabin in the Woods \nsprings to mind with it’s postmodern smarts and real unpredictability. However,\nit’s rare that the U.S nowadays can produce a clever, well constructed and\ngenuinely original horror film without having to wink at its audience\nironically.\n\nThankfuly, there is Adam Wingard who proved with his last effort You’re Next \nthat the old ways aren’t quite dead, doing for John Carpenter what Super 8 did\nfor Spielberg. With gleeful gore, a synthesizer lead soundtrack and a strong\nfemale protagonist, You’re Next didn’t so much provide anything new as it did\nreturn, with affection and sincerity, to how things used to be done. His follow\nup, The Guest, is also filled to the brim with that same genre know-how.\nHowever, it’s much harder to classify, in fact it seems to resist labeling\naltogether, even if it is set at Halloween and was screened at this year’s \nFrightfest. Not quite an action film, not quite a psychological thriller, not\nquite a slasher, the film is a mix of all of these and more (it even has a small\nelement of sci-fi) to create something that is hugely enjoyable.\n\nAt a lean 99 minutes, it also tells its story without unnecessary length. A\nnuclear-family, the Petersons, mourn the loss of their eldest son Caleb to the\nwar in Afghanistan, when one day an unexpected visitor shows up declaring that\nhe knew him. The soldier, David (Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens), is welcomed into\nthe house with open arms, whereupon he reveals that he made a promise to Caleb,\nto check on his family and make sure that they were okay. He proceeds to do so\nwith extreme dedication: helping youngest child Luke defend himself from\nbullies, aiding Luke’s Sister Anna with her relationship problems and so on.\nSeemingly adored by everyone, David continues to live as a house-guest in the\nPeterson’s home, however it eventually becomes apparent that he is not who he\nseems to be. Revealing too much more would spoil the fun, but it is always quite\nclear where things are heading.\n\nMost of the attention will focus on Steven’s electrifying performance and\nrightly so. Remarkably charismatic, even when you know of his lethal intentions,\nit’s hard to side against the supremely polite, overly courteous psychopath.\nSteven’s succeeds in going back and forth between ultimate nice guy and ultimate\nbad guy in the blink of an eye, his manner not changing a beat when he does so,\nmaking the transition all the more threatening. When he informs someone he is\ngoing to kill them with the same inflection with which he gratefully accepts the\noffer of a beer, it prompts an uneasy chuckle.\n\nSteven’s winning charisma may be what captures the broader audience’s attention,\nbut for genre aficionados it’s Wingard’s reverence for the old school that will\nreally impress.

On second thought, ‘’cinematic’’ might\nnot be the most appropriate term for his outings. After all, whilst the festive\nmenace has certainly appeared in his fair share of films, he’s only graced\nmultiplex screens on one occasion. This was for Michael Dougherty’s supremely\nenjoyable, 2015 Horror-Comedy, Krampus, which can be distinguished as ‘’the only\nproper one’’.\n\nElsewhere, the anthropomorphic goat-demon has been firmly relegated to\nstraight-to-DVD atrocities, such as Krampus: The Christmas Devil (Deplorable), \nKrampus: The Reckoning (Ghastly), Krampus: Unleashed (Bilious) and something\ncalled Mother Krampus (???). Naturally, these are all cheap cash-ins, farted out\naround the Yuletide in order to fill up supermarket bargain bins and the more\nundernourished sections on Amazon Prime.\n\nTargeted at less discerning viewers (like yours truly), they aim to sucker in\nanyone with an itch for holiday horror, which is a gambit that must surely pay\noff for them, otherwise they wouldn’t keep doing it. Indeed, for us connoisseurs\nof trash, watching these dumpster fires is a veritable Holiday tradition, akin\nto putting up a tree, caroling, or spending the entirety of Christmas day\nneglecting your social obligations, so that you can play a new video game.\n\nAnd with the release of Krampus Origins, the season is upon us yet again! To be\nfair, this year’s offering is nowhere near as horrendous as some of its\nforebears, by virtue of being largely in focus and having some form of a\nscreenplay. Nevertheless, it’s still a laborious watch, one that is severely\nweighed down by a humourless tone, weak production-values and crippling pacing\nissues.\n\nThe film opens at the tail end of World War 1, with a largely irrelevant\nprologue sequence set deep behind enemy lines. Here, we watch as a band of\nAmerican soldiers, garbed in ill-fitting uniforms, carry out a\nsearch-and-destroy raid on a German bunker. After successfully clearing the base\nof hostiles, the grunts begin to scour the area for intel. In the process, one\nof them happens upon an ancient tome that is filled with all kinds of eldritch\nknowledge, cryptic spells and handy instructions for performing occult rituals.\nThe young man confiscates the writings but before he can deliver them to his\nsuperiors, he is unceremoniously gunned down by a hidden enemy squadron.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later and we are now in small-town Arizona, where the\nsoldier’s possessions are promptly bequeathed to his wife, who is a teacher at\nthe local orphanage. Overcome with sorrow, the grieving widow does not take the\nopportunity to examine these belongings and instead dumps them on her desk. As\nyou have likely guessed, the aforementioned evil text is among the items and is\nquickly purloined by one of the school’s disruptive students.\n\nSuffice it to say, it’s not long before the little trouble-maker is reading\naloud from the malevolent manuscript, because presumably that’s how children\nentertained themselves prior to the advent of Shrek memes and Fornite. Anyway,\nto cut a long-story-short, she accidentally invokes the spirit of Krampus, at\nwhich point a generic slasher movie is set in motion. Albeit one where all the\nexciting stuff occurs off-screen.\n\nIn case it was somehow not obvious, Krampus Origins is a load of cack. But that\ncomes with territory where you’re making this kind of schlock. What’s less\npredictable though, are all the strange and idiosyncratic ways that the film\nmanages to screw up.\n\nFor instance, the production design is all over the place. Some of the period\ndetail is beautiful realised, with authentic looking paraphernalia, old-timey\ncars and even era-appropriate branding. Yet on the flip side, everything is so\ndreadfully sparse, with sets that are frankly naked and unfinished . You\nsubsequently get the impression that the crew stumbled across a disused factory,\nroughly 5 minutes before shooting, and then hastily tried to renovate it in a\nfeeble attempt to eradicate any trace of modernity. Because the rooms are all\nconspicuously bare, the furnishings are non-existent, and you can see where the\nplug sockets have been visibly ripped from the walls. This might come across as\nnit-picky, but it’s very distracting once you notice it.\n\nLikewise, the central MacGuffin (The Spell Book) might be one of the least \nbelievable props in movie history. Again, you could dispute that this isn’t a\nworthy subject of criticism but they insist on shoving the bloody thing in your\nface with all these endless close-ups. It’s like they’re proud of it!\n\nConsequently, you have no choice but to scrutinise the blatantly fake and\nfreshly-printed document. To their credit, they’ve attempted to make the spine\nlook charred and degraded, but their method for doing this is to merely slap\nsome flimsy black material over the cover. Likewise, they have obviously\ncrumpled up the pages and dipped them in tea in order to artificially yellow\nthem, like you would with a school project! You can’t turn a blind eye to this\nkind of awfulness.\n\nNor can you overlook the astonishingly bad audio quality. On that note, was\nevery other line recorded on a separate device? Because some people sound like\nthey’re in front of a mic in a professional studio, some sound like they’re on\nlocation in an echoey corridor and others sound like they’re communicating from\nthe great beyond, ala the little girl in Poltergeist. Occasionally, the ADR\nbecomes so tinny and muffled that conversations devolve into incomprehensible\nmumbling, a problem that is exacerbated to-no-end by the fact that half of the\ncast seem to have been ‘’discovered’ at the nearest community theatre.\n\nYou really can’t understand what the hell they’re supposed to be saying and this\nis a quality that the film unaccountably doubles-down on, by giving half of the\ncharacters weird vocal quirks and irritating mannerisms. To wit, there’s the one\nkid with the unconvincing stutter, the one with the badly affected British\naccent (who curiously has the sociolect of a Victorian aristocrat) and the one\nwho turns up halfway through and may-or-may-not have a speech impediment.\n\nOh, and there’s also the drunk priest, who overdoes the slurring to such a\nludicrous extent, that you’d be forgiven for assuming that he has a learning\ndifficulty. When all these actors are thrust together into the same dizzying\nexchange, it can be an incredibly grating to sit through, but also perversely\namusing at the same time.\n\nBest of all however is the undignified depiction of Krampus himself, who is just\nas embarrassing as everyone else, if not worse! This is partly down to the\ndemon’s (cost-friendly) ability to shapeshift and impersonate others. Granted,\nthat could be an interesting twist if the script was willing to expand upon the\nidea, but it’s clearly just a transparent way of keeping the effects budget\ndown. In fact, the villain spends the vast majority of the film incognito as a\ncrappy Damien Thorn rip-off and doing very little Krampusing.\n\nSo, anyone hoping for fun, creature-feature action is going to be sorely\ndisappointed. Instead, you’ll have to settle for watching another ‘’creepy’’ kid\nmovie, as if we don’t have enough of those already. It doesn’t help that he’s\nsuch an adorable little tyke and his most menacing attribute is that he gives\npeople hard stares, like he’s fucking Paddington or something!\n\nHaving said that, when Krampus finally bothers to shed his disguise- in the last\n20 minutes of the movie- then you instantly understand why the filmmakers were\nso hesitant to reveal him. With a visual design straight out of Monty Python and\nthe Holy Grail and a voice so preposterously throaty that it makes Dr Claw sound\nlike Taylor Swift, he is a legitimately risible antagonist. Compounding the\nissue, he also inexplicably draws out the last syllable of every word, like\nsomeone who is suffering from painful constipation.\n\nWhilst all of that might seem amusing on paper, it’s worth reiterating that \nKrampus Origins is not a candidate for the ‘’so-bad-it’s-good’’ club. On the\ncontrary, it’s an aggressively morose slog, one that is severely lacking in\nincident, drama and scares (The titular ”origin” is also absent, with Krampus\nbeing an established entity at the beginning of the film). Even the small\nnuggets of amusement that can be gleaned, like the unintentional laughs\ndescribed above, are few-and-far between.\n\nHonestly, it’s a tad depressing, what with all the illusions to orphaned\nchildren and wartime tragedies. There are no (deliberate) moments of levity to\nalleviate the mood either, which you’d think would be a key ingredient for any\nKrampus story. He’s evil Santa for Christ sake! Why would you place that\ncharacter in anything other than a horror-comedy?  Alas if you’re hoping for\nsome trashy fun, then this arduous chore will not satisfy that craving. Nor will\nit satiate anyone who is looking for a fundamentally competent film.\n\nOh well, at least we still have the proper one.","html":"<p><br>Even by the miserable standards of other Folkloric characters, Krampus has a particularly wretched cinematic legacy.

This is partly down to the demon’s (cost-friendly) ability to shapeshift and impersonate others. Granted, that could be an interesting twist if the script was willing to expand upon the idea, but it’s clearly just a transparent way of keeping the effects budget down. In fact, the villain spends the vast majority of the film incognito as a crappy Damien Thorn rip-off and doing very little Krampusing.<br><br>So, anyone hoping for fun, creature-feature action is going to be sorely disappointed. Instead, you’ll have to settle for watching another ‘’creepy’’ kid movie, as if we don’t have enough of <em>those</em> already. It doesn’t help that he’s such an adorable little tyke and his most menacing attribute is that he gives people hard stares, like he’s fucking Paddington or something!<br><br>Having said that, when Krampus finally bothers to shed his disguise- in the last 20 minutes of the movie- then you instantly understand why the filmmakers were so hesitant to reveal him. With a visual design straight out of <strong>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</strong> and a voice so preposterously throaty that it makes Dr Claw sound like Taylor Swift, he is a legitimately risible antagonist. Compounding the issue, he also inexplicably draws out the last syllable of <em>every</em> word, like someone who is suffering from painful constipation.<br><br>Whilst all of that might seem amusing on paper, it’s worth reiterating that <strong>Krampus Origins</strong> is not a candidate for the ‘’so-bad-it’s-good’’ club. On the contrary, it’s an aggressively morose slog, one that is severely lacking in incident, drama and scares (The titular ”origin” is also absent, with Krampus being an established entity at the beginning of the film). Even the small nuggets of amusement that can be gleaned, like the unintentional laughs described above, are few-and-far between.<br><br>Honestly, it’s a tad depressing, what with all the illusions to orphaned children and wartime tragedies. There are no (deliberate) moments of levity to alleviate the mood either, which you’d think would be a key ingredient for any Krampus story. He’s evil Santa for Christ sake! Why would you place that character in anything <em>other</em> than a horror-comedy?  Alas if you’re hoping for some trashy fun, then this arduous chore will not satisfy that craving. Nor will it satiate anyone who is looking for a fundamentally competent film.<br><br>Oh well, at least we still have the proper one.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/msOyJSKp8tU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-krampus-origins/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b6e6cfdd-fc02-47f7-919e-12d16a058528","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"602eafb4a400d8001ce99e5f","reading_time":6}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__602ebf2caf0a2d001c114c55","title":"Review | For the Love of the Boogeyman: 40 Years of Halloween","slug":"review-love-of-boogeyman","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault--1-.jpg","excerpt":"Although it clearly comes from a place of love, For the Love of the Boogeyman is a shallow documentary that has little new to offer.","custom_excerpt":"Although it clearly comes from a place of love, For the Love of the Boogeyman is a shallow documentary that has little new to offer.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"18 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"13 October, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"22 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-18T19:25:32.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-10-13T19:26:00.000+01:00","updated_at":"2021-02-22T12:34:14.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harrison Abbott","slug":"harrisonabbot","bio":"Opinionated, Verbose and Generally Pedantic.

If all these elements\nconverge, then you should have no trouble competing with high-profile franchises\nand comic-book adaptations.\n\nWhannel clearly appreciates this, as each of his projects has been made on a\nshoestring budget. Moreover, whilst his output hasn’t been universally great, he\nhas consistently shown that he is a competent pair of hands and a dependable\nmoney-maker to boot. Because of this aptitude for working cheap, he has now\ngarnered enough industry cred to pursue whatever zany passion project takes his\nfancy.\n\nWhich brings us to the writer-turned-director’s latest offering, Upgrade. A\ngenre blending, cyberpunk, revenge flick, this is something that Whannel has\nbeen developing for years and like all of his previous work it has generated a\nlot of buzz despite its relatively humble origins (the estimated budget is\nsomewhere around the $5 million mark, which probably wouldn’t cover the catering\nfor most blockbusters). Praised for its intriguing premise and stylised\nhyper-violence, the film has already established a cult following, with many\npundits suggesting that it puts its more expensive peers to shame.\n\nNow- two months after its US release- Upgrade is debuting overseas, which means\nthat the rest of the world can finally jump aboard the hype train. But is the\nunassuming thriller really worth all the pomp and circumstance?\n\n\nSet in a future that is just around the corner, the film focuses on Grey (Logan\nMarshall-Green), a technophobe who has the misfortune of living in a society\ncompletely dominated by computers. Law enforcement is reliant upon drone\nsurveillance, smart houses take care of their own upkeep and even recreational\ndrug use has been supplanted by an addiction to VR. Everything is ostensibly\nsmoother and more convenient, yet Grey remains ever-sceptical and yearns for the\ngolden age of vinyl records, analogue devices and vehicles that require actual\nhuman drivers.\n\nOne day, after refurbishing an old car for a famous tech guru, Grey is treated\nto a showcase of the inventor’s latest creation; an AI chip named STEM. The\nscientist excitedly explains that the revolutionary implant can be inserted into\na person’s body to serve as a kind of secondary brain, giving the recipient\nenhanced motor skills, heightened agility and even increased intelligence. Of\ncourse, Grey is characteristically cynical about this and suggests that mankind\ndoesn’t really need such an upgrade.\n\nThis attitude changes however, when a fateful car accident leaves both Grey and\nhis wife susceptible to violent criminals. In an ensuing attack, the former is\nleft paralysed from the waist down and the latter is tragically killed.\n\nDetermined to track down his mysterious assailants, the bereaved husband\nabandons his old-fashioned ideals and volunteers as a Guinea pig for STEM, in\nthe hope that he can regain his ability to walk and get revenge. In the process,\nhe finds that he is not only restored to his original condition, but that he has\neven been augmented with incredible new skills. Now armed with superhuman\nsenses, a proficiency in martial arts and the capacity to switch off his pain\nreceptors, Grey decides to find his wife’s killers and assassinate them in\nincreasingly gory ways.\n\nRight off the bat, it’s fair to say that the premise is absolutely terrific,\nlike Death Wish crossed with a particularly good episode of Black Mirror. Yet\nthat only gives you a rough idea of what’s in store and to spoil the interesting\ntwists would be a disservice to Whannel’s sharp writing and inventive\nstorytelling.\n\nSure the surface-level gist of ‘’spouse-on-a quest-for-revenge’’ has been\ntrotted out a thousand times before in cinema, but here it’s all being presented\nwith a fresh coat of cybernetic-enhanced paint. After all, the movie’s core\ngimmick changes everything from how the investigation scenes play out, to how\nthe protagonist conceals his vigilantism from the police.\n\nBest of all though is how the idea affects the action sequences, which are all\nexpertly shot, masterfully choreographed and dizzyingly energetic. To give you a\nflavour of what makes these moments so special, Grey can hand over total control\nto STEM whenever he is faced with confrontation. Once the AI takes the wheel in\nthese scenarios, then our hero is transformed into a perfect killing machine,\ncapable of mesmerising acrobatics, astonishing brutality and predicting his\nopponent’s next move with the utmost accuracy.\n\nAs is to be expected, the resultant fights are pleasingly ferocious, if a little\ninfrequent and too short (the slow pacing is a bit of an issue). They are also\nstrangely funny as well, because STEM is unable to influence anything above\nGrey’s neck, and so the system has to manually move his head out of the way to\ndodge incoming blows. This makes for a unique visual, reminiscent of something\nfrom a slapstick cartoon. It’s also amusing to see the squeamish hero forced\ninto the role of a bemused observer, powerless as his own independently limbs\nflail around and cause all kinds of mayhem.\n\nWith these enjoyably kinetic scenes, Whannel demonstrates that a low-budget\nneedn’t be an obstacle to creativity and he also gives Marshall-Green a proper\nopportunity to show off his surprising comedic muscles. On that note, the\nactor’s animated depiction of a man constantly amazed by his own actions injects\nwelcome levity into a character that could otherwise be quite dour and\nunlikeable. That being said, he’s still very good at carrying the film through\nits more emotional beats when the need arises.\n\nElsewhere, every of other aspect of Upgrade is spot on. The believable sci-fi\nsetting is remarkably well-thought out and realistic. There are no jetpacks, no\nflying cars, or spaceships, just tiny little details like surgeons who use X-ray\ncontact lenses to perform operations.\n\nThis is a smart decision on the part of the screenwriter, as the refreshingly\ngrounded approach allows the film to tackle some fairly ambitious themes in its\nsecond half, examining humanity’s dependence on technology and whether or not we\nare making ourselves obsolete. In fact, as the film moves towards its climax, it\nbecomes less concerned with set-pieces and instead dedicates itself to a more\ncerebral breed of science-fiction.\n\nIt then all culminates in a darkly shocking ending that will stay with you for\ndays. In this sense, it’s a rare film that actually disguises its intelligence\nand demonstrates that being clever and being fun don’t have to be mutually\nexclusive concepts.","html":"<p>As the mastermind behind several modestly-funded hits, like <strong>Insidious</strong> and the early <strong>Saw</strong> movies, Leigh Whannel has repeatedly proven that you don’t need the resources of a Hollywood Blockbuster in order to thrill audiences.<br><br>Instead, all you need is a strong idea, a little ingenuity and some talented colleagues to help bring your vision to the screen.

Praised for its intriguing premise and stylised hyper-violence, the film has already established a cult following, with many pundits suggesting that it puts its more expensive peers to shame.<br><br>Now- two months after its US release- <strong>Upgrade</strong> is debuting overseas, which means that the rest of the world can finally jump aboard the hype train. But is the unassuming thriller really worth all the pomp and circumstance?<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/upgrade-600x338.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Set in a future that is just around the corner, the film focuses on Grey (Logan Marshall-Green), a technophobe who has the misfortune of living in a society completely dominated by computers. Law enforcement is reliant upon drone surveillance, smart houses take care of their own upkeep and even recreational drug use has been supplanted by an addiction to VR. Everything is ostensibly smoother and more convenient, yet Grey remains ever-sceptical and yearns for the golden age of vinyl records, analogue devices and vehicles that require actual human drivers.<br><br>One day, after refurbishing an old car for a famous tech guru, Grey is treated to a showcase of the inventor’s latest creation; an AI chip named STEM. The scientist excitedly explains that the revolutionary implant can be inserted into a person’s body to serve as a kind of secondary brain, giving the recipient enhanced motor skills, heightened agility and even increased intelligence. Of course, Grey is characteristically cynical about this and suggests that mankind doesn’t really need such an upgrade.<br><br>This attitude changes however, when a fateful car accident leaves both Grey and his wife susceptible to violent criminals. In an ensuing attack, the former is left paralysed from the waist down and the latter is tragically killed.<br><br>Determined to track down his mysterious assailants, the bereaved husband abandons his old-fashioned ideals and volunteers as a Guinea pig for STEM, in the hope that he can regain his ability to walk and get revenge. In the process, he finds that he is not only restored to his original condition, but that he has even been augmented with incredible new skills. Now armed with superhuman senses, a proficiency in martial arts and the capacity to switch off his pain receptors, Grey decides to find his wife’s killers and assassinate them in increasingly gory ways.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Upgrade-2-600x400.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Right off the bat, it’s fair to say that the premise is absolutely terrific, like <strong>Death Wish</strong> crossed with a particularly good episode of <strong>Black Mirror.</strong> Yet that only gives you a rough idea of what’s in store and to spoil the interesting twists would be a disservice to Whannel’s sharp writing and inventive storytelling.<br><br>Sure the surface-level gist of ‘’spouse-on-a quest-for-revenge’’ has been trotted out a thousand times before in cinema, but here it’s all being presented with a fresh coat of cybernetic-enhanced paint. After all, the movie’s core gimmick changes everything from how the investigation scenes play out, to how the protagonist conceals his vigilantism from the police.<br><br>Best of all though is how the idea affects the action sequences, which are all expertly shot, masterfully choreographed and dizzyingly energetic. To give you a flavour of what makes these moments so special, Grey can hand over total control to STEM whenever he is faced with confrontation. Once the AI takes the wheel in these scenarios, then our hero is transformed into a perfect killing machine, capable of mesmerising acrobatics, astonishing brutality and predicting his opponent’s next move with the utmost accuracy.<br><br>As is to be expected, the resultant fights are pleasingly ferocious, if a little infrequent and too short (the slow pacing is a bit of an issue). They are also strangely funny as well, because STEM is unable to influence anything above Grey’s neck, and so the system has to manually move his head out of the way to dodge incoming blows. This makes for a unique visual, reminiscent of something from a slapstick cartoon. It’s also amusing to see the squeamish hero forced into the role of a bemused observer, powerless as his own independently limbs flail around and cause all kinds of mayhem.<br><br>With these enjoyably kinetic scenes, Whannel demonstrates that a low-budget needn’t be an obstacle to creativity and he also gives Marshall-Green a proper opportunity to show off his surprising comedic muscles. On that note, the actor’s animated depiction of a man constantly amazed by his own actions injects welcome levity into a character that could otherwise be quite dour and unlikeable. That being said, he’s still very good at carrying the film through its more emotional beats when the need arises.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/--------600x261.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Elsewhere, every of other aspect of <strong>Upgrade</strong> is spot on. The believable sci-fi setting is remarkably well-thought out and realistic. There are no jetpacks, no flying cars, or spaceships, just tiny little details like surgeons who use X-ray contact lenses to perform operations.<br><br>This is a smart decision on the part of the screenwriter, as the refreshingly grounded approach allows the film to tackle some fairly ambitious themes in its second half, examining humanity’s dependence on technology and whether or not we are making ourselves obsolete. In fact, as the film moves towards its climax, it becomes less concerned with set-pieces and instead dedicates itself to a more cerebral breed of science-fiction.<br><br>It then all culminates in a darkly shocking ending that will stay with you for days. In this sense, it’s a rare film that actually disguises its intelligence and demonstrates that being clever and being fun don’t have to be mutually exclusive concepts.</p>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-upgrade/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"626fb597-1651-4756-854a-22b653a91aeb","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60337b31f58067001c4568ea","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__6034cde6753168001c92fefc","title":"Review | The Meg","slug":"review-the-meg-2","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/gsmea1rx9mly2ufrw3hm.png","excerpt":"That's one bad film Harry","custom_excerpt":"That's one bad film Harry","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"23 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"03 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"23 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-23T09:41:58.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-03T09:41:00.000+01:00","updated_at":"2021-02-23T09:47:45.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harrison Abbott","slug":"harrisonabbot","bio":"Opinionated, Verbose and Generally Pedantic.

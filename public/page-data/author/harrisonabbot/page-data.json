On second thought, ‘’cinematic’’ might\nnot be the most appropriate term for his outings. After all, whilst the festive\nmenace has certainly appeared in his fair share of films, he’s only graced\nmultiplex screens on one occasion. This was for Michael Dougherty’s supremely\nenjoyable, 2015 Horror-Comedy, Krampus, which can be distinguished as ‘’the only\nproper one’’.\n\nElsewhere, the anthropomorphic goat-demon has been firmly relegated to\nstraight-to-DVD atrocities, such as Krampus: The Christmas Devil (Deplorable), \nKrampus: The Reckoning (Ghastly), Krampus: Unleashed (Bilious) and something\ncalled Mother Krampus (???). Naturally, these are all cheap cash-ins, farted out\naround the Yuletide in order to fill up supermarket bargain bins and the more\nundernourished sections on Amazon Prime.\n\nTargeted at less discerning viewers (like yours truly), they aim to sucker in\nanyone with an itch for holiday horror, which is a gambit that must surely pay\noff for them, otherwise they wouldn’t keep doing it. Indeed, for us connoisseurs\nof trash, watching these dumpster fires is a veritable Holiday tradition, akin\nto putting up a tree, caroling, or spending the entirety of Christmas day\nneglecting your social obligations, so that you can play a new video game.\n\nAnd with the release of Krampus Origins, the season is upon us yet again! To be\nfair, this year’s offering is nowhere near as horrendous as some of its\nforebears, by virtue of being largely in focus and having some form of a\nscreenplay. Nevertheless, it’s still a laborious watch, one that is severely\nweighed down by a humourless tone, weak production-values and crippling pacing\nissues.\n\nThe film opens at the tail end of World War 1, with a largely irrelevant\nprologue sequence set deep behind enemy lines. Here, we watch as a band of\nAmerican soldiers, garbed in ill-fitting uniforms, carry out a\nsearch-and-destroy raid on a German bunker. After successfully clearing the base\nof hostiles, the grunts begin to scour the area for intel. In the process, one\nof them happens upon an ancient tome that is filled with all kinds of eldritch\nknowledge, cryptic spells and handy instructions for performing occult rituals.\nThe young man confiscates the writings but before he can deliver them to his\nsuperiors, he is unceremoniously gunned down by a hidden enemy squadron.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later and we are now in small-town Arizona, where the\nsoldier’s possessions are promptly bequeathed to his wife, who is a teacher at\nthe local orphanage. Overcome with sorrow, the grieving widow does not take the\nopportunity to examine these belongings and instead dumps them on her desk. As\nyou have likely guessed, the aforementioned evil text is among the items and is\nquickly purloined by one of the school’s disruptive students.\n\nSuffice it to say, it’s not long before the little trouble-maker is reading\naloud from the malevolent manuscript, because presumably that’s how children\nentertained themselves prior to the advent of Shrek memes and Fornite. Anyway,\nto cut a long-story-short, she accidentally invokes the spirit of Krampus, at\nwhich point a generic slasher movie is set in motion. Albeit one where all the\nexciting stuff occurs off-screen.\n\nIn case it was somehow not obvious, Krampus Origins is a load of cack. But that\ncomes with territory where you’re making this kind of schlock. What’s less\npredictable though, are all the strange and idiosyncratic ways that the film\nmanages to screw up.\n\nFor instance, the production design is all over the place. Some of the period\ndetail is beautiful realised, with authentic looking paraphernalia, old-timey\ncars and even era-appropriate branding. Yet on the flip side, everything is so\ndreadfully sparse, with sets that are frankly naked and unfinished . You\nsubsequently get the impression that the crew stumbled across a disused factory,\nroughly 5 minutes before shooting, and then hastily tried to renovate it in a\nfeeble attempt to eradicate any trace of modernity. Because the rooms are all\nconspicuously bare, the furnishings are non-existent, and you can see where the\nplug sockets have been visibly ripped from the walls. This might come across as\nnit-picky, but it’s very distracting once you notice it.\n\nLikewise, the central MacGuffin (The Spell Book) might be one of the least \nbelievable props in movie history. Again, you could dispute that this isn’t a\nworthy subject of criticism but they insist on shoving the bloody thing in your\nface with all these endless close-ups. It’s like they’re proud of it!\n\nConsequently, you have no choice but to scrutinise the blatantly fake and\nfreshly-printed document. To their credit, they’ve attempted to make the spine\nlook charred and degraded, but their method for doing this is to merely slap\nsome flimsy black material over the cover. Likewise, they have obviously\ncrumpled up the pages and dipped them in tea in order to artificially yellow\nthem, like you would with a school project! You can’t turn a blind eye to this\nkind of awfulness.\n\nNor can you overlook the astonishingly bad audio quality. On that note, was\nevery other line recorded on a separate device? Because some people sound like\nthey’re in front of a mic in a professional studio, some sound like they’re on\nlocation in an echoey corridor and others sound like they’re communicating from\nthe great beyond, ala the little girl in Poltergeist. Occasionally, the ADR\nbecomes so tinny and muffled that conversations devolve into incomprehensible\nmumbling, a problem that is exacerbated to-no-end by the fact that half of the\ncast seem to have been ‘’discovered’ at the nearest community theatre.\n\nYou really can’t understand what the hell they’re supposed to be saying and this\nis a quality that the film unaccountably doubles-down on, by giving half of the\ncharacters weird vocal quirks and irritating mannerisms. To wit, there’s the one\nkid with the unconvincing stutter, the one with the badly affected British\naccent (who curiously has the sociolect of a Victorian aristocrat) and the one\nwho turns up halfway through and may-or-may-not have a speech impediment.\n\nOh, and there’s also the drunk priest, who overdoes the slurring to such a\nludicrous extent, that you’d be forgiven for assuming that he has a learning\ndifficulty. When all these actors are thrust together into the same dizzying\nexchange, it can be an incredibly grating to sit through, but also perversely\namusing at the same time.\n\nBest of all however is the undignified depiction of Krampus himself, who is just\nas embarrassing as everyone else, if not worse! This is partly down to the\ndemon’s (cost-friendly) ability to shapeshift and impersonate others. Granted,\nthat could be an interesting twist if the script was willing to expand upon the\nidea, but it’s clearly just a transparent way of keeping the effects budget\ndown. In fact, the villain spends the vast majority of the film incognito as a\ncrappy Damien Thorn rip-off and doing very little Krampusing.\n\nSo, anyone hoping for fun, creature-feature action is going to be sorely\ndisappointed. Instead, you’ll have to settle for watching another ‘’creepy’’ kid\nmovie, as if we don’t have enough of those already. It doesn’t help that he’s\nsuch an adorable little tyke and his most menacing attribute is that he gives\npeople hard stares, like he’s fucking Paddington or something!\n\nHaving said that, when Krampus finally bothers to shed his disguise- in the last\n20 minutes of the movie- then you instantly understand why the filmmakers were\nso hesitant to reveal him. With a visual design straight out of Monty Python and\nthe Holy Grail and a voice so preposterously throaty that it makes Dr Claw sound\nlike Taylor Swift, he is a legitimately risible antagonist. Compounding the\nissue, he also inexplicably draws out the last syllable of every word, like\nsomeone who is suffering from painful constipation.\n\nWhilst all of that might seem amusing on paper, it’s worth reiterating that \nKrampus Origins is not a candidate for the ‘’so-bad-it’s-good’’ club. On the\ncontrary, it’s an aggressively morose slog, one that is severely lacking in\nincident, drama and scares (The titular ”origin” is also absent, with Krampus\nbeing an established entity at the beginning of the film). Even the small\nnuggets of amusement that can be gleaned, like the unintentional laughs\ndescribed above, are few-and-far between.\n\nHonestly, it’s a tad depressing, what with all the illusions to orphaned\nchildren and wartime tragedies. There are no (deliberate) moments of levity to\nalleviate the mood either, which you’d think would be a key ingredient for any\nKrampus story. He’s evil Santa for Christ sake! Why would you place that\ncharacter in anything other than a horror-comedy?  Alas if you’re hoping for\nsome trashy fun, then this arduous chore will not satisfy that craving.

Granted that is a very salient point, but there’s something more\nspecific unifying this miserable bunch.\n\nIndeed, the true commonality here is that each of these limp releases was\ninfamously neutered by their respective studios, all for the sake of lowering\nthe MPAA rating. With conspicuously absent violence and embarrassingly-censored\nlanguage, these sanitized misfires all fell completely flat. This is because\nthey were forced to sacrifice their integrity at the altar of an ill-fitting\nPG-13 certificate.\n\nYou may recall a time when this undignified fate was imposed upon most\nblockbusters. After all, it used to be standard practice for the industry to\nwater down explicitly mature properties, in order to make them more palatable to\nyounger viewers. This was especially true around the turn of the millennium,\nwhen Hollywood inexplicably convinced itself that R-ratings were no longer\nprofitable and so turned its back on them altogether.\n\nThis arbitrary mindset lead to studios sabotaging their own products, so that\nthey could appeal to a broader audience and maximise ticket sales. There was a\nsubsequent pandemic of lameness, with iconic horrors being reduced to tame,\nbloodless affairs (The Fog) and action flicks transforming into timid shadows of\ntheir former selves (Taken 2).\n\nFans were naturally opposed to the trend and yearned for the halcyon days of\nhigh body-counts, graphic decapitations and liberally deployed F-bombs. But it\nwasn’t just the ‘’basement dwellers’’ complaining either, as slowly-but-surely\neveryone became sick of the dreaded ‘’PG-13-ification’’. This fatigue extended\nfrom the general public, to professional reviewers and even filmmakers\nthemselves, who felt like they were being routinely hamstrung.\n\nThe Triumphant R-Resurgence\n\nHowever, you’ve probably noticed a dramatic shift occurring in the last few\nyears, with the pendulum swinging in the other direction entirely. Now, studios\ncan’t get enough of R-ratings and are trying to cram as much NSFW content into\ntheir releases as humanly possible. They’re even going so far as to commission\nreshoots\n[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/03/fox-could-be-overhauling-the-new-mutants-reshooting-nearly-fifty-percent-of-the-film/] \nand alternative cuts\n[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/06/blu-ray-review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-ultimate-edition-2016/]\n, all with the express purpose of bumping up the certificate. It’s like they’ve\ndone a complete 180!\n\nThis seismic change can largely be attributed to the earth-shattering success of \nDeadpool, the plucky underdog that surpassed all box-office expectations back in\n2016. Indeed, off the back of the watershed hit, Hollywood has been\n(re)convinced that ‘’mature’’ films can be commercially viable. By extension,\nthe potty-mouthed sensation has almost single-handedly ushered in a new era of\nR-rated supremacy and everybody wants a piece of the action.\n\nAs a result, the industry is currently in the midst of a veritable frenzy, with\nstudios going out of their way to find any edgy or risque franchises to call\ntheir own. In fact, the R-rating has now become a badge of honour among movies:\none that is synonymous with cool; fun; and daringness. In comparison, having a\nPG-13 just makes you look kind of stuffy and behind-the-times.\n\nHistory Repeats Itself\n\nAs one of those whiners who spent years lamenting the ostracism of the R-rating,\nI can attest that this transition has been vindicating. What’s more, some truly\nfantastic films have spawned from the mania, ones that would have otherwise been\nunthinkable, like the recent It adaptation and Logan.\n\nStill, it would be naive to think that studios have learned their lesson. Sure,\nthey’ve gleaned something from the merc-with-a-mouth’s lucrative performance,\nyet the conclusion they’ve arrived at is typically misguided and simplistic.\nThey should have realised the value of taking risks and of placing greater\nconfidence in their filmmakers. They should have seen the error of their ways\nand resolved to no longer tamper with art. But instead, they are now under the\nimpression that an R-rating is the be-all-and-end-all and that gore, nudity, or\nprofanity will automatically make their films more popular. Which is why they’re\nnow trying to compel their productions into meeting this criteria.\n\nBecause make no mistake, they’re still interfering with movies and feebly trying\nto contrive ways of second-guessing the market. The only difference is that\nthey’re now doing it in the inverse direction and want everything to be\n‘’hardcore’’, irrespective of whether it makes any goddamn sense! I mean, just\nlook at some of these proposed reimaginings: R-rated Star Trek; R-rated \nTransformers, R-rated Superman! It’s madness.\n\nJust like Alien Vs Predator never suited a PG-13, these properties have\nabsolutely no business adopting a restricted certificate. Having Bumblebee say\n“Fuck” isn’t going to improve things for the Transformers series, it’s just\ngoing to feel awkward and jarring. Likewise, Star Trek is supposed to be a\nhopeful and optimistic vision of the future: one built on notions of tolerance;\nopen-mindedness; and peaceful cohabitation. So to reconfigure the whole thing as\na gritty nightmare about the “Horrors of Space” would be a betrayal of its very\nessence.\n\nIn fact, slapping an out-of-place R over the top of Star Trek will cause just as\nmuch damage as stripping the R away from Die Hard did. The principle remains the\nsame, as the industry is still meddling with its films and is still prioritising\nthose MPAA ratings over their creative instinct.\n\nWhilst having an R might be in vogue right now, that doesn’t negate the fact\nthat each movie needs to be assessed on its own terms! Some, like Star Wars or \nSpider-Man, ought to be suitable for consumption by anyone. They’re innocent\nadventure stories and need to have a lighter feel that’s in keeping with that\ntone. Contrastingly, things like The Raid, John Wick, or Kingsman absolutely\nrely on being able to push the boat out and so need the flexibility that a\nhigher certificate provides.\n\nThe thing is, producers should be able to easily identify which of their\nproperties fall into which camp. Yet they have repeatedly demonstrated that they\nare incapable of making these judgements sensibly. First they thought that a \nRobocop remake would be worthwhile without the blood, and now they seem to think\nthat the key to salvaging Transformers is to have Optimus Prime orchestrate a\ngang-bang or something. Frankly, if a person believes that such a franchise\n(which let me remind you, is based on a toyline) would benefit from an R-rating,\nthen they’re probably not the right person to be helming that particular\nproject. Honestly, the situation is getting out of hand. And should things carry\non in this vein, then R-mania is going to have just as many casualties as\nPG-13-ification ever did.\n\nR-Ratings Are Not a Magic Fix\n\nOf course, we all know this isn’t really about the improving quality of films.\nNo, if an adult Transformers ever does materialise, then it won’t be a\ncreatively-motivated decision. On the contrary, it’ll be the result of some\ncynical executive sticking their nose in and deciding that such a venture would\nincrease their profit margins. Why? Because Rs are the “in thing” right now and\nthere’s no artistic justification beyond that.\n\nSpeaking of which, does anyone else feel like these transparent attempts to ride\non Deadpool’s coattails are becoming increasingly desperate? Look at The\nHappytime Murders. Its marketing was wholly dependent upon the viewer being\nattracted to lazy dick jokes and other tired, raunchy gags. The fact that they\ndidn’t shown anything especially funny was presumably irrelevant, because it was\nR and that was meant to be enough. It’s all the trailer had to work with and it\nmilked that selling point for every last drop, practically screaming “Look,\nwe’re edgy! We’ve got swearing! Please like us!”\n\nWorse still, a lot of people seem to be drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. You\ncan already see pundits getting carried away, placing far too much weight on the\nintrinsic merit of an R, as if they expect it to inherently lead to better\nmovies. For instance, there’s a staggering amount of articles out there\nsuggesting that Venom’s fate ultimately hinged on whether it would attain a\nrestricted certificate, like that alone would have made the difference between\nit being a bad or good film. Likewise, The Predator was swept up in a similar\ndiscussion and when we all discovered that it actually was going to be an R,\nthen the delirious excitement this generated ended up overshadowing the more\nimportant things: like the troubling behind the scenes rumours and the\nwell-documented reshoots. Even decade-old movies are now being roped into the\ndiscussion, with Nic Cage positing that Ghost Rider would have been more\nbearable had it only\nbeen an R\n[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/04/nicolas-cage-wants-r-rated-ghost-rider-someone-else-part/] \n(I suppose that’d be true if you ignore the bad screenwriting, lackluster\ndirection and poor VFX).\n\nBut in the end a certificate couldn’t save Venom, nor would it have ever rescued \nGhost Rider. For adult content alone is not enough to centre a movie on.\nAdmittedly, when used well things like violence can complement a film, but in\nthese instances it’s just the icing on the cake. Now that might seem obvious to\nyou, but it’s a lesson that the industry could do with internalising. After all,\nas long as they continue to steer films into specific ratings (be it G, PG-13,\nor R), then they are just shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nObviously there are some caveats to this. Like if Paul King wanted to open \nPandington 3 with unsimulated oral sex, then it would probably be wise for\nsomeone to intervene. But unless directors intend on doing something that\nblatantly inappropriate (you know, like a fucking R-rated Star Trek), then\nproducers should simply let the creative process take its natural course.\nBecause ratings need to be earned organically and more importantly, they should\nalways be the end-result of unfettered artistic decisions.

I myself wrote a particularly conceited essay about it at\nUniversity, despite being unable to formulate a remotely compelling argument.

But\nthere’s not enough meat on those bones to justify a paltry video-essay, never\nmind a 40 minute project comprised of dozens of interviewees!\n\nWhat’s worse is that, over the course of the piece, alternate readings are never\neven hinted at, giving it a very narrow view. This is partly because the talking\nheads are all interchangeable, with comparable interests and matching opinions.\nConsequently, they all approach the material from the same, bland position.\nThere’s no contrast to the discussion here. No variety. No back and forth. Just\npeople rabbiting on in circles about how much they love a 40 year-old movie.\n\nGiven that none of the presenters actually worked on Halloween, you would think\nthat they’d at least have interesting takes to make their commentary worth\nlistening to. But they don’t! They just offer banal praise of every facet of the\nfilm-making, like they’re dutifully ticking off all the Oscar categories or\nsomething.\n\n”The acting is great. And the directing is great. And the cinematography is\ngreat. And the production design is great. And the music is great. And the best\nanimated film is great!’ If you want to simulate the experience of watching For\nthe Love of the Boogeyman, simply copy and paste that quote about 200 times and\nyou’ll get the picture.\n\nIt’s just a surface-level appraisal that only serves to endorse a\npre-established consensus. No one needs to be told that Halloween is a fantastic\nmovie, that’s pretty well cemented by now. If that’s all you’ve got to say, then\nyour project has more in common with an episode of Collider Movie Talk than it\ndoes with an actual documentary.\n\nAlthough this shortcoming is disappointing, it isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker.\nAfter all, it can be nice to listen to people talk passionately about something\nthey love, even if they don’t have anything especially original to contribute.\nWhat severely hampers Boogeyman however, is the fact that its interviewees\ndeliver near-identical soundbites throughout.\n\nIt turns out that they’re not only on the same page as one another, but\nsometimes the exact same fucking sentence! Every time that someone comments on a\nspecific aspect of the movie- be it Jamie Lee Curtis’ formidable performance,\nthe unknowable presence of The Shape, or the way that synth music acts as a\nmetaphorical voice for Michael Myers- you then have to listen to that same point\nbeing repeated ad nauseum by about 20 other people Before long  you start to\nfeel like you’re in some kind of hellish echo chamber.\n\nOf course, it’s only natural that people will have similar feelings when talking\nabout one of the greatest horror films ever made. The talking heads aren’t\nnecessarily to blame for that. But if you’re the person putting this documentary\ntogether, then it’s your job to weed out such duplications.\n\nSpeaking of editing, the rhythm of cutting here is awfully distracting, as we’re\nconstantly jumping around between talking heads without a chance to properly\nsettle. You rarely stay with a single person for longer than 10 seconds, so none\nof them are afforded the opportunity to meaningfully expand upon their arguments\nor substantiate them with evidence. Sometimes you can even hear them being\ncut-short mid-sentence, just so they can be interrupted by someone else. It all\nadds to the insubstantial feeling that presides over the entire documentary,\nwhere everything comes across so slight and bitty.\n\nAt least the visuals are okay: cycling through different locations and giving us\ncool memorabilia to look at (kudos to Paul Stier and Nathan Thomas Milliner for\nthe impressive artwork). It would have been nice to have clips from Halloween to\nbetter illustrate points and break up the interviews but if there were legal\nobstructions preventing this from happening, then the production team obviously\ncan’t be blamed for that.\n\nOver all, For the Love of the Boogeyman’s is a rather simplistic and\nunder-cooked offering. You could argue that it’s intention is not really to pick\napart its subject, and that it just wants to celebrate the anniversary of a\nlandmark release. But if that’s the case, then there are far more entertaining\nways of doing that.","html":"<p>Ask any genre enthusiast to break down the success of <strong>Halloween</strong> and they are all-but-guaranteed to have a full-blown thesis prepared for such an occasion.

Just people rabbiting on in circles about how much they love a 40 year-old movie.<br><br>Given that none of the presenters actually worked on <strong>Halloween</strong>, you would think that they’d at least have interesting takes to make their commentary worth listening to. But they don’t! They just offer banal praise of every facet of the film-making, like they’re dutifully ticking off all the Oscar categories or something.<br><br>”The acting is great. And the directing is great. And the cinematography is great. And the production design is great. And the music is great. And the best animated film is great!’ If you want to simulate the experience of watching <strong>For the Love of the Boogeyman</strong>, simply copy and paste that quote about 200 times and you’ll get the picture.<br><br>It’s just a surface-level appraisal that only serves to endorse a pre-established consensus. No one needs to be told that <strong>Halloween</strong> is a fantastic movie, that’s pretty well cemented by now. If that’s all you’ve got to say, then your project has more in common with an episode of Collider Movie Talk than it does with an actual documentary.</p><p>Although this shortcoming is disappointing, it isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker.<br>After all, it can be nice to listen to people talk passionately about something they love, even if they don’t have anything especially original to contribute. What <em>severely</em> hampers <strong>Boogeyman</strong> however, is the fact that its interviewees deliver near-identical soundbites throughout.<br><br>It turns out that they’re not only on the same page as one another, but sometimes the exact same fucking sentence! Every time that someone comments on a specific aspect of the movie- be it Jamie Lee Curtis’ formidable performance, the unknowable presence of The Shape, or the way that synth music acts as a metaphorical voice for Michael Myers- you then have to listen to that same point being repeated ad nauseum by about 20 other people Before long  you start to feel like you’re in some kind of hellish echo chamber.<br><br>Of course, it’s only natural that people will have similar feelings when talking about one of the greatest horror films ever made. The talking heads aren’t necessarily to blame for that. But if you’re the person putting this documentary together, then it’s your job to weed out such duplications.<br><br>Speaking of editing, the rhythm of cutting here is awfully distracting, as we’re constantly jumping around between talking heads without a chance to properly settle. You rarely stay with a single person for longer than 10 seconds, so none of them are afforded the opportunity to meaningfully expand upon their arguments or substantiate them with evidence. Sometimes you can even hear them being cut-short mid-sentence, just so they can be interrupted by someone else. It all adds to the insubstantial feeling that presides over the entire documentary, where everything comes across so slight and bitty.<br><br>At least the visuals are okay: cycling through different locations and giving us cool memorabilia to look at (kudos to Paul Stier and Nathan Thomas Milliner for the impressive artwork). It would have been nice to have clips from <strong>Halloween</strong> to better illustrate points and break up the interviews but if there were legal obstructions preventing this from happening, then the production team obviously can’t be blamed for that.<br><br>Over all, <strong>For the Love of the Boogeyman’s</strong> is a rather simplistic and under-cooked offering. You could argue that it’s intention is not really to pick apart its subject, and that it just wants to celebrate the anniversary of a landmark release. But if that’s the case, then there are far more entertaining ways of doing that.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtSsPQWqxFM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-love-of-boogeyman/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"9f63af8d-d86a-4815-a3e5-aa214c923c66","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"602ebf2caf0a2d001c114c55","reading_time":4}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60337b31f58067001c4568ea","title":"Review | Upgrade","slug":"review-upgrade","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/upgrade-600x338.jpg","excerpt":"Whannel demonstrates that a low-budget needn’t be an obstacle to creativity","custom_excerpt":"Whannel demonstrates that a low-budget needn’t be an obstacle to creativity","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"22 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"04 September, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"22 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-22T09:36:49.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-09-04T09:36:00.000+01:00","updated_at":"2021-02-22T09:39:37.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harrison Abbott","slug":"harrisonabbot","bio":"Opinionated, Verbose and Generally Pedantic.

If all these elements\nconverge, then you should have no trouble competing with high-profile franchises\nand comic-book adaptations.\n\nWhannel clearly appreciates this, as each of his projects has been made on a\nshoestring budget. Moreover, whilst his output hasn’t been universally great, he\nhas consistently shown that he is a competent pair of hands and a dependable\nmoney-maker to boot. Because of this aptitude for working cheap, he has now\ngarnered enough industry cred to pursue whatever zany passion project takes his\nfancy.\n\nWhich brings us to the writer-turned-director’s latest offering, Upgrade. A\ngenre blending, cyberpunk, revenge flick, this is something that Whannel has\nbeen developing for years and like all of his previous work it has generated a\nlot of buzz despite its relatively humble origins (the estimated budget is\nsomewhere around the $5 million mark, which probably wouldn’t cover the catering\nfor most blockbusters). Praised for its intriguing premise and stylised\nhyper-violence, the film has already established a cult following, with many\npundits suggesting that it puts its more expensive peers to shame.\n\nNow- two months after its US release- Upgrade is debuting overseas, which means\nthat the rest of the world can finally jump aboard the hype train. But is the\nunassuming thriller really worth all the pomp and circumstance?\n\n\nSet in a future that is just around the corner, the film focuses on Grey (Logan\nMarshall-Green), a technophobe who has the misfortune of living in a society\ncompletely dominated by computers. Law enforcement is reliant upon drone\nsurveillance, smart houses take care of their own upkeep and even recreational\ndrug use has been supplanted by an addiction to VR. Everything is ostensibly\nsmoother and more convenient, yet Grey remains ever-sceptical and yearns for the\ngolden age of vinyl records, analogue devices and vehicles that require actual\nhuman drivers.\n\nOne day, after refurbishing an old car for a famous tech guru, Grey is treated\nto a showcase of the inventor’s latest creation; an AI chip named STEM. The\nscientist excitedly explains that the revolutionary implant can be inserted into\na person’s body to serve as a kind of secondary brain, giving the recipient\nenhanced motor skills, heightened agility and even increased intelligence. Of\ncourse, Grey is characteristically cynical about this and suggests that mankind\ndoesn’t really need such an upgrade.\n\nThis attitude changes however, when a fateful car accident leaves both Grey and\nhis wife susceptible to violent criminals. In an ensuing attack, the former is\nleft paralysed from the waist down and the latter is tragically killed.\n\nDetermined to track down his mysterious assailants, the bereaved husband\nabandons his old-fashioned ideals and volunteers as a Guinea pig for STEM, in\nthe hope that he can regain his ability to walk and get revenge. In the process,\nhe finds that he is not only restored to his original condition, but that he has\neven been augmented with incredible new skills. Now armed with superhuman\nsenses, a proficiency in martial arts and the capacity to switch off his pain\nreceptors, Grey decides to find his wife’s killers and assassinate them in\nincreasingly gory ways.\n\nRight off the bat, it’s fair to say that the premise is absolutely terrific,\nlike Death Wish crossed with a particularly good episode of Black Mirror. Yet\nthat only gives you a rough idea of what’s in store and to spoil the interesting\ntwists would be a disservice to Whannel’s sharp writing and inventive\nstorytelling.\n\nSure the surface-level gist of ‘’spouse-on-a quest-for-revenge’’ has been\ntrotted out a thousand times before in cinema, but here it’s all being presented\nwith a fresh coat of cybernetic-enhanced paint. After all, the movie’s core\ngimmick changes everything from how the investigation scenes play out, to how\nthe protagonist conceals his vigilantism from the police.\n\nBest of all though is how the idea affects the action sequences, which are all\nexpertly shot, masterfully choreographed and dizzyingly energetic. To give you a\nflavour of what makes these moments so special, Grey can hand over total control\nto STEM whenever he is faced with confrontation. Once the AI takes the wheel in\nthese scenarios, then our hero is transformed into a perfect killing machine,\ncapable of mesmerising acrobatics, astonishing brutality and predicting his\nopponent’s next move with the utmost accuracy.\n\nAs is to be expected, the resultant fights are pleasingly ferocious, if a little\ninfrequent and too short (the slow pacing is a bit of an issue). They are also\nstrangely funny as well, because STEM is unable to influence anything above\nGrey’s neck, and so the system has to manually move his head out of the way to\ndodge incoming blows. This makes for a unique visual, reminiscent of something\nfrom a slapstick cartoon. It’s also amusing to see the squeamish hero forced\ninto the role of a bemused observer, powerless as his own independently limbs\nflail around and cause all kinds of mayhem.\n\nWith these enjoyably kinetic scenes, Whannel demonstrates that a low-budget\nneedn’t be an obstacle to creativity and he also gives Marshall-Green a proper\nopportunity to show off his surprising comedic muscles. On that note, the\nactor’s animated depiction of a man constantly amazed by his own actions injects\nwelcome levity into a character that could otherwise be quite dour and\nunlikeable. That being said, he’s still very good at carrying the film through\nits more emotional beats when the need arises.\n\nElsewhere, every of other aspect of Upgrade is spot on. The believable sci-fi\nsetting is remarkably well-thought out and realistic. There are no jetpacks, no\nflying cars, or spaceships, just tiny little details like surgeons who use X-ray\ncontact lenses to perform operations.\n\nThis is a smart decision on the part of the screenwriter, as the refreshingly\ngrounded approach allows the film to tackle some fairly ambitious themes in its\nsecond half, examining humanity’s dependence on technology and whether or not we\nare making ourselves obsolete. In fact, as the film moves towards its climax, it\nbecomes less concerned with set-pieces and instead dedicates itself to a more\ncerebral breed of science-fiction.\n\nIt then all culminates in a darkly shocking ending that will stay with you for\ndays. In this sense, it’s a rare film that actually disguises its intelligence\nand demonstrates that being clever and being fun don’t have to be mutually\nexclusive concepts.","html":"<p>As the mastermind behind several modestly-funded hits, like <strong>Insidious</strong> and the early <strong>Saw</strong> movies, Leigh Whannel has repeatedly proven that you don’t need the resources of a Hollywood Blockbuster in order to thrill audiences.<br><br>Instead, all you need is a strong idea, a little ingenuity and some talented colleagues to help bring your vision to the screen.

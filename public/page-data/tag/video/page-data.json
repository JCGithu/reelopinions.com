But yeah, give it a read if you're interested in more.\n\nMary the Witch's Flower is the first film by Studio Ponoc; meaning \"midnight\" or\n\"a brand new day\" as a majority are staff that have left Studio Ghibli to start\ntheir own company. Yonebayashi, the director, he originally did ‘When Marnie Was\nThere’ and ‘The Secret Life of Arietty’, and basically when Studio Ghibli\nstarted shutting now and it’s masters announced they were no longer producing\nfeature films, its younger staff thought: \"Well... We still want to do stuff.\nWe'd like to have jobs\" and so they have set off on their own ways.\n\nThere is a quote from the original book that they cited a lot in a lot of the\ninterview materials  where Mary says at one point: \"I want to open this door but\nI want to open it without using magic no matter how long that takes\" and that is\nkind of how they've cited their mindset going into this film. They wanted a\ncharacter that liked magic, but then realized at the end of it that they no\nlonger needed magic to be who they were. That is the context that they've seen\nfor moving on from the magic of Studio Ghibli.\n\nI understand that concept, however I think that they don't push far enough with\nthis film to be completely separate from the past.\n\nI also think there's something with that statement where you say \"We don't want\nmagic\" – as it’s disregarding that that is the aspect most people like about\nStudio Ghibli? They like that it's got this magical element to it, this fantasy,\nthis wonder, and saying we want to leave the magic of Studio Ghibili behind -- I\nknow that they're  highlighting its reputation moreso than the actual style of\nthe films, because this is very much a continuation of that. But it's a\ntouchstone that I think highlights a few of the flaws going into the final\nproduct.\n\nMary and the Witch's Flower is based on the English novel The Little Broomstick.\nMary has moved to live with her elderly aunt in the countryside and it's summer\nso she's just waiting to start school in this new area. So she's left in the\nhouse with just elderly people and nothing to really do and so she's very bored\nand she slowly starts exploring the nearby countryside. While doing that she\nfollows some cats finds the magical witch's flower and a broomstick. By crushing\none of the flower’s berries she gains magical powers for those 24 hours and the\nbroom sets off and takes her away to Endor College where she finds a magical\nheadmistress and plots happens, as it tends to do sometimes.\n\nAs films go it's not particularly flawed in any way, it's just missing that\nmagic that they wanted to kind of step away from. Mary feels like a compilation\nof all the kind of stubborn Ghibili girls rolled into one, but with nothing in\nparticular defining her. It's also a very similar plot of being whisked away to\na magical building run by a kind of creepy crony old woman who uses magic to\ncontrol the girl at several times and it ultimately wraps into a story of\nTechnology versus nature. So to say this is a film that is entirely branching\nout from what's happened before would be… untruthful.\n\nThey have also said in all the promotional materials that they didn't\ndeliberately go out to try and make a film that would be popular and make money\n- they wanted to make something that they wanted to make; and again I think, is\nthat really true? Because, granted, the director’s previous two books that he's\nadapted into films are English fantasy novels by female writers around the same\nera, So that's definitely in his MO, but the past two films were definitely\nsmaller in scale and a lot more focused on human drama and emotions. Whereas\nthis is on a much larger scale and just seems to skim over a lot of the human\nelement of the film.\n\nAs you could probably see in the trailer obviously the animation is just\ntop-notch all the way through. I think they've put a majority of the kind of\nflourishes in the trailer so you've probably already seen it on this video but\nthere are some really amazingly animated sections.\n\nI don't know why I've left off this review so long because I saw it a while ago\nand when I think back to it I just think that there wasn't that much to remember\nabout it. Like I said the characters were kind of cut-out, the plot was... I\nwouldn't venture to say predictable but it wasn't particularly imaginative and\nthe moments where the film was being imaginative it seemed to really brush over\nto get back to a plot that I wasn't that interested in.

It's a big one. It's Avengers Infinity War\nwhich comes out I suppose 36 hours from when this comes out I think, and it's\ngood. It's genuinely really good. It already says in the title of the video but\njust to clarify, definitely no spoilers are here. Not even vaguely spoiler\nstuff, I just want to keep focusing on... not necessarily vague points but\nnonspecific.\n\nI'm going to be splitting up this review kind of into two parts. One focusing on\nthe experience of the film and the other being the film itself which will make\nsense when I get onto it. If you were just a big Marvel fan and you're going\nthrough the reviews on YouTube trying to find if you should believe the hype or\nnot then I would say, one, listen just to the first half of this video, and two,\nyes I would say so. Which is rare for me because I don't think I've said that\nfor a Marvel film for a long time. Possibly not since the first Avengers.\n\nThe reason I'm going to be breaking up the review into two parts is that as a\nfilm I think it's great but has a few flaws but as like a movie cinematic event\nI think that it is the most effective it's being in a long long time and I think\nthat even for myself, not a super fan of the series, I found myself honestly\ncaptivated and enthralled as to what was going to come next. Even staying away\nfrom fan theories you hear the fan theories and I think one very important point\nto make is that it surprised me which is not something a Marvel film has done in\na long time. It genuinely surprised me, there were moments where I couldn't\nbelieve that they made those choices. Perhaps more because I kind of view it so\nmuch as a (in context) as a very safe series so maybe that led into me being\nmuch more surprised. But I think that just leads into my ongoing point that I\nthink fans are definitely going to get exactly what they were hoping for with\nthis film. I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe comedy is an improvement still on civil war and becomes much more hit than\nmiss it is still hit and miss for me but much more hit this time. All of the\nmatchups I think with characters meeting each other for the first time, I think\nthat they play off each other very well in almost every single scene - and\ncoming into that the creative way which the Russos dealt with the fight\nchoreography in Civil War definitely continues with this. Constantly trying to\nfind new ways to just make these superheroes combine and find new interesting\nways to try and make their powers fun to watch. I'm just so surprised that I\nthink that they did manage to live up to the expectations of everything that's\nbeen set up to this film. I think there could be some controversial decisions\nthat maybe some fans don't enjoy but I don't think any fan could say that they\ndidn't deliver on the premise of this film. As a cinema experience I would say\nthat it was the one of the most enjoyable I've had in a long time, genuinely,\nand again coming not as a complete super fan of the series.\n\nNow is the part of the video where I'll jump into some of the flaws that I found\nwith it - so if you just wanted to hear the full positive stuff maybe tune out\nnow. I'm not ripping into it or anything just that it's small aspects where I\nwasn't necessarily disappointed but I thought it could be improved upon and\ncertain story beats that I think could be if anything just cut or changed. Again\nwith being vague and spoiler free.\n\nFirstly is the cinematography which, considering the amount that they poured\ninto this film does not I think look as impressive as they hoped and I find that\nthe ways in which the Russos put the camera I find actually takes away sometimes\nfrom what's happening on screen. I don't think that they portray action in the\nbest way that they possibly could. However, I will say that every time they have\na creative idea involving shots then that's pulled off very well, surprisingly,\nso it's a weird mixture where I think when the moments where it counts I think\nthey pull off some really great visual moments, but in a lot of the hand-to-hand\ncombat and less important moments in this film I think that the camerawork feels\nlike sloppy and almost unclear at points. Not to a point where it's completely\ndetrimental to the film, but parts where I just thought it didn't feel like it\nwas tightly made. Maybe they are going for slightly more off-the-cuff aspect to\nit, to try and give a kind of more realistic feel to everything, but I think\nthey just kind of came off as – when you're doing it in such a massive CGI world\nfor a lot of the film it doesn't come off that way, it comes off as kind of easy\ncamerawork and I think it shows off a lot of how they are directors that have\ncome from TV.\n\nAnother middling point is that sometimes I think some of the initial\ninteractions between the characters I think happened very quickly just because\nwant to get this show on the road. This doesn't feel like a long film but this\nis a long film they have a lot to get through and so I can understand that\nsometimes they need to rush through some introductions but I think like, for\ninstance, some of the characters meeting aliens for the first time that seemed\nto be very brushed under the rug and just kind of \"Let's go. Keep up the pace.\nWe got to keep going.\" From the moment the film starts it never really stops\ngoing the whole film and I find it admirable but yeah I just think there were\ncertain parts that were brushed under the rug a bit too much to get on with the\naction. There's only one newly established character in this film which is Peter\nDinklage and I thought his character was stupid. I didn't take it seriously the\nwhole time he was on screen and I know you could say that this was a film where\nyou're not meant to take everything completely seriously but it was just a silly\ncharacter.\n\nI'm genuinely amazed for some of the story points that they went with in the\nend. Oh, and the story points thing that I wanted to touch on is just that I\nbriefly said about fan theories earlier and I think that that has kind of come\ninto play into the script. I've talked a lot in recent reviews about how the\nidea that fans reactions to things, because of internet culture, I think media\nis becoming a lot more reactionary to fans responses for things and I think\ncertain scenes in this play into that a tiny bit. Not so necessarily much in a\nfanservice way but just in a way that it's clearly playing off fans expectations\nand again for those scenes.\n\nI think that they could have been played differently or to be honest scrapped in\norder of more character building moments as opposed to setting up more questions\njust for the sake of more questions.\n\nAgain, I'm trying to stay vague but if someone watches the film and then comes\nback to this review I think that they might pretty easily put what scenes I'm\ntrying to explain. It was genuinely impressive film, a really fun experience in\nthe cinema, and while I don't think it will be like my favourite film of the\nyear or anything like that I think that this goes to show it's just if anything\nit proves it as a big experiment that I think has paid off and I think that is\nultimately going to cement it in a lot of fans hearts as like a true favorite\nseries now.","html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PebXG6oLsgw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p><strong>Transcript</strong><br><br>Hi and welcome back to Reel Opinions.

Again with being vague and spoiler free.<br><br>Firstly is the cinematography which, considering the amount that they poured into this film does not I think look as impressive as they hoped and I find that the ways in which the Russos put the camera I find actually takes away sometimes from what's happening on screen. I don't think that they portray action in the best way that they possibly could. However, I will say that every time they have a creative idea involving shots then that's pulled off very well, surprisingly, so it's a weird mixture where I think when the moments where it counts I think they pull off some really great visual moments, but in a lot of the hand-to-hand combat and less important moments in this film I think that the camerawork feels like sloppy and almost unclear at points. Not to a point where it's completely detrimental to the film, but parts where I just thought it didn't feel like it was tightly made. Maybe they are going for slightly more off-the-cuff aspect to it, to try and give a kind of more realistic feel to everything, but I think they just kind of came off as – when you're doing it in such a massive CGI world for a lot of the film it doesn't come off that way, it comes off as kind of easy camerawork and I think it shows off a lot of how they are directors that have come from TV.<br><br>Another middling point is that sometimes I think some of the initial interactions between the characters I think happened very quickly just because want to get this show on the road. This doesn't feel like a long film but this is a long film they have a lot to get through and so I can understand that sometimes they need to rush through some introductions but I think like, for instance, some of the characters meeting aliens for the first time that seemed to be very brushed under the rug and just kind of \"Let's go. Keep up the pace. We got to keep going.\" From the moment the film starts it never really stops going the whole film and I find it admirable but yeah I just think there were certain parts that were brushed under the rug a bit too much to get on with the action. There's only one newly established character in this film which is Peter Dinklage and I thought his character was stupid. I didn't take it seriously the whole time he was on screen and I know you could say that this was a film where you're not meant to take everything completely seriously but it was just a silly character.<br><br>I'm genuinely amazed for some of the story points that they went with in the end. Oh, and the story points thing that I wanted to touch on is just that I briefly said about fan theories earlier and I think that that has kind of come into play into the script. I've talked a lot in recent reviews about how the idea that fans reactions to things, because of internet culture, I think media is becoming a lot more reactionary to fans responses for things and I think certain scenes in this play into that a tiny bit. Not so necessarily much in a fanservice way but just in a way that it's clearly playing off fans expectations and again for those scenes.<br><br>I think that they could have been played differently or to be honest scrapped in order of more character building moments as opposed to setting up more questions just for the sake of more questions.<br><br>Again, I'm trying to stay vague but if someone watches the film and then comes back to this review I think that they might pretty easily put what scenes I'm trying to explain. It was genuinely impressive film, a really fun experience in the cinema, and while I don't think it will be like my favourite film of the year or anything like that I think that this goes to show it's just if anything it proves it as a big experiment that I think has paid off and I think that is ultimately going to cement it in a lot of fans hearts as like a true favorite series now.</p>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-infinity-war-spoilers/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"4b33f6b1-731a-4f77-864f-e0da6b90bfb4","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60355f08a276c9001cd98610","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60339d311e9ddd001c49f409","title":"Review | Isle of Dogs","slug":"review-isle-of-dogs","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/isle-of-doogie.jpg","excerpt":"Wes Anderson's second animated feature is his most entertaining yet!","custom_excerpt":"Wes Anderson's second animated feature is his most entertaining yet!","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"22 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"07 April, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"22 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-22T12:01:53.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-04-07T12:01:00.000+01:00","updated_at":"2021-02-22T12:03:57.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"James Chadwick","slug":"jameschadwick","bio":"Long-suffering Pompey fan.

The Isle of Dogs is an abandoned island\nupon which all of the dogs in the fictional city of Megasaki are banished after\nan epidemic of dog flu breaks out.

Nevertheless with a true old school spirit and a captivating central performance, <em>The Guest</em> is a welcome shot in the arm for the horror genre…. if indeed it even is a horror film.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtV3L3IuTkA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-the-guest/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"7f013e61-ce59-4c12-ba91-122633aee146","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"602ce2841f83ac001cfcb8b9","reading_time":3}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60299fc72df188001c75fe8a","title":"Best Films of 2014","slug":"best-films-of-2014","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault1.jpg","excerpt":"Our first ever Reel Opinions where we talk about the best films of 2014.","custom_excerpt":null,"visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"14 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"13 December, 2014","updated_at_pretty":"15 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-14T22:10:15.000+00:00","published_at":"2014-12-13T22:10:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-02-15T16:48:09.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Reel Opinions","slug":"reelopinions","bio":"Reel Opinions is a UK based publication that covers just about anything TV, Film, and Videogames.","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/91aede0d82aaa5238293b241277dc54f?s=250&d=mm&r=x","twitter":"@reel_opinions","facebook":null,"website":"https://reelopinions.com"}],"primary_author":{"name":"Reel Opinions","slug":"reelopinions","bio":"Reel Opinions is a UK based publication that covers just about anything TV, Film, and Videogames.","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/91aede0d82aaa5238293b241277dc54f?s=250&d=mm&r=x","twitter":"@reel_opinions","facebook":null,"website":"https://reelopinions.com"},"primary_tag":{"name":"Review","slug":"reviews","description":"Reviews for everything!","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Review","slug":"reviews","description":"Reviews for everything!","feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Lists","slug":"lists","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Top 10","slug":"top-10","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Video","slug":"video","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"Our first ever Reel Opinions where we talk about the best films of 2014.","html":"<p>Our first ever Reel Opinions where we talk about the best films of 2014.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFs2xxrRtxE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/best-films-of-2014/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"baac8283-5b7d-4fab-9dee-beb9cfc946d2","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60299fc72df188001c75fe8a","reading_time":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"video","pageNumber":0,"humanPageNumber":1,"skip":0,"limit":15,"numberOfPages":1,"previousPagePath":"","nextPagePath":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["176528973","2358152166","2561578252","2731221146","4145280475"]}

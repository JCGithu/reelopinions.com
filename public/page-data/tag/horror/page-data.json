On second thought, ‘’cinematic’’ might\nnot be the most appropriate term for his outings. After all, whilst the festive\nmenace has certainly appeared in his fair share of films, he’s only graced\nmultiplex screens on one occasion. This was for Michael Dougherty’s supremely\nenjoyable, 2015 Horror-Comedy, Krampus, which can be distinguished as ‘’the only\nproper one’’.\n\nElsewhere, the anthropomorphic goat-demon has been firmly relegated to\nstraight-to-DVD atrocities, such as Krampus: The Christmas Devil (Deplorable), \nKrampus: The Reckoning (Ghastly), Krampus: Unleashed (Bilious) and something\ncalled Mother Krampus (???). Naturally, these are all cheap cash-ins, farted out\naround the Yuletide in order to fill up supermarket bargain bins and the more\nundernourished sections on Amazon Prime.\n\nTargeted at less discerning viewers (like yours truly), they aim to sucker in\nanyone with an itch for holiday horror, which is a gambit that must surely pay\noff for them, otherwise they wouldn’t keep doing it. Indeed, for us connoisseurs\nof trash, watching these dumpster fires is a veritable Holiday tradition, akin\nto putting up a tree, caroling, or spending the entirety of Christmas day\nneglecting your social obligations, so that you can play a new video game.\n\nAnd with the release of Krampus Origins, the season is upon us yet again! To be\nfair, this year’s offering is nowhere near as horrendous as some of its\nforebears, by virtue of being largely in focus and having some form of a\nscreenplay. Nevertheless, it’s still a laborious watch, one that is severely\nweighed down by a humourless tone, weak production-values and crippling pacing\nissues.\n\nThe film opens at the tail end of World War 1, with a largely irrelevant\nprologue sequence set deep behind enemy lines. Here, we watch as a band of\nAmerican soldiers, garbed in ill-fitting uniforms, carry out a\nsearch-and-destroy raid on a German bunker. After successfully clearing the base\nof hostiles, the grunts begin to scour the area for intel. In the process, one\nof them happens upon an ancient tome that is filled with all kinds of eldritch\nknowledge, cryptic spells and handy instructions for performing occult rituals.\nThe young man confiscates the writings but before he can deliver them to his\nsuperiors, he is unceremoniously gunned down by a hidden enemy squadron.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks later and we are now in small-town Arizona, where the\nsoldier’s possessions are promptly bequeathed to his wife, who is a teacher at\nthe local orphanage. Overcome with sorrow, the grieving widow does not take the\nopportunity to examine these belongings and instead dumps them on her desk. As\nyou have likely guessed, the aforementioned evil text is among the items and is\nquickly purloined by one of the school’s disruptive students.\n\nSuffice it to say, it’s not long before the little trouble-maker is reading\naloud from the malevolent manuscript, because presumably that’s how children\nentertained themselves prior to the advent of Shrek memes and Fornite. Anyway,\nto cut a long-story-short, she accidentally invokes the spirit of Krampus, at\nwhich point a generic slasher movie is set in motion. Albeit one where all the\nexciting stuff occurs off-screen.\n\nIn case it was somehow not obvious, Krampus Origins is a load of cack. But that\ncomes with territory where you’re making this kind of schlock. What’s less\npredictable though, are all the strange and idiosyncratic ways that the film\nmanages to screw up.\n\nFor instance, the production design is all over the place. Some of the period\ndetail is beautiful realised, with authentic looking paraphernalia, old-timey\ncars and even era-appropriate branding. Yet on the flip side, everything is so\ndreadfully sparse, with sets that are frankly naked and unfinished . You\nsubsequently get the impression that the crew stumbled across a disused factory,\nroughly 5 minutes before shooting, and then hastily tried to renovate it in a\nfeeble attempt to eradicate any trace of modernity. Because the rooms are all\nconspicuously bare, the furnishings are non-existent, and you can see where the\nplug sockets have been visibly ripped from the walls. This might come across as\nnit-picky, but it’s very distracting once you notice it.\n\nLikewise, the central MacGuffin (The Spell Book) might be one of the least \nbelievable props in movie history. Again, you could dispute that this isn’t a\nworthy subject of criticism but they insist on shoving the bloody thing in your\nface with all these endless close-ups. It’s like they’re proud of it!\n\nConsequently, you have no choice but to scrutinise the blatantly fake and\nfreshly-printed document. To their credit, they’ve attempted to make the spine\nlook charred and degraded, but their method for doing this is to merely slap\nsome flimsy black material over the cover. Likewise, they have obviously\ncrumpled up the pages and dipped them in tea in order to artificially yellow\nthem, like you would with a school project! You can’t turn a blind eye to this\nkind of awfulness.\n\nNor can you overlook the astonishingly bad audio quality. On that note, was\nevery other line recorded on a separate device? Because some people sound like\nthey’re in front of a mic in a professional studio, some sound like they’re on\nlocation in an echoey corridor and others sound like they’re communicating from\nthe great beyond, ala the little girl in Poltergeist. Occasionally, the ADR\nbecomes so tinny and muffled that conversations devolve into incomprehensible\nmumbling, a problem that is exacerbated to-no-end by the fact that half of the\ncast seem to have been ‘’discovered’ at the nearest community theatre.\n\nYou really can’t understand what the hell they’re supposed to be saying and this\nis a quality that the film unaccountably doubles-down on, by giving half of the\ncharacters weird vocal quirks and irritating mannerisms. To wit, there’s the one\nkid with the unconvincing stutter, the one with the badly affected British\naccent (who curiously has the sociolect of a Victorian aristocrat) and the one\nwho turns up halfway through and may-or-may-not have a speech impediment.\n\nOh, and there’s also the drunk priest, who overdoes the slurring to such a\nludicrous extent, that you’d be forgiven for assuming that he has a learning\ndifficulty. When all these actors are thrust together into the same dizzying\nexchange, it can be an incredibly grating to sit through, but also perversely\namusing at the same time.\n\nBest of all however is the undignified depiction of Krampus himself, who is just\nas embarrassing as everyone else, if not worse! This is partly down to the\ndemon’s (cost-friendly) ability to shapeshift and impersonate others. Granted,\nthat could be an interesting twist if the script was willing to expand upon the\nidea, but it’s clearly just a transparent way of keeping the effects budget\ndown. In fact, the villain spends the vast majority of the film incognito as a\ncrappy Damien Thorn rip-off and doing very little Krampusing.\n\nSo, anyone hoping for fun, creature-feature action is going to be sorely\ndisappointed. Instead, you’ll have to settle for watching another ‘’creepy’’ kid\nmovie, as if we don’t have enough of those already. It doesn’t help that he’s\nsuch an adorable little tyke and his most menacing attribute is that he gives\npeople hard stares, like he’s fucking Paddington or something!\n\nHaving said that, when Krampus finally bothers to shed his disguise- in the last\n20 minutes of the movie- then you instantly understand why the filmmakers were\nso hesitant to reveal him. With a visual design straight out of Monty Python and\nthe Holy Grail and a voice so preposterously throaty that it makes Dr Claw sound\nlike Taylor Swift, he is a legitimately risible antagonist. Compounding the\nissue, he also inexplicably draws out the last syllable of every word, like\nsomeone who is suffering from painful constipation.\n\nWhilst all of that might seem amusing on paper, it’s worth reiterating that \nKrampus Origins is not a candidate for the ‘’so-bad-it’s-good’’ club. On the\ncontrary, it’s an aggressively morose slog, one that is severely lacking in\nincident, drama and scares (The titular ”origin” is also absent, with Krampus\nbeing an established entity at the beginning of the film). Even the small\nnuggets of amusement that can be gleaned, like the unintentional laughs\ndescribed above, are few-and-far between.\n\nHonestly, it’s a tad depressing, what with all the illusions to orphaned\nchildren and wartime tragedies. There are no (deliberate) moments of levity to\nalleviate the mood either, which you’d think would be a key ingredient for any\nKrampus story. He’s evil Santa for Christ sake! Why would you place that\ncharacter in anything other than a horror-comedy?  Alas if you’re hoping for\nsome trashy fun, then this arduous chore will not satisfy that craving. Nor will\nit satiate anyone who is looking for a fundamentally competent film.\n\nOh well, at least we still have the proper one.","html":"<p><br>Even by the miserable standards of other Folkloric characters, Krampus has a particularly wretched cinematic legacy.

I myself wrote a particularly conceited essay about it at\nUniversity, despite being unable to formulate a remotely compelling argument. I\njust ended up reiterating what countless others had already articulated before\nme and ultimately failed to say anything more insightful than ”that Michael\nMyers is well creepy!’\n\nUnfortunately, a similar critique can be leveled at For the Love of the\nBoogeyman, a sycophantic documentary that tellingly markets itself as being made\n‘by fans and for the fans”. Translation: ”it’s a fawning circle-jerk, with\nlittle-to-no substance and a startling lack of fresh perspective”.  So in that\nsense, it is strikingly reminiscent of my flimsy uni assignment, only much\nlonger and with less uses of the word ”thus”.\n\nYou see, there’s no illuminating analysis to speak of here, just people\nrepeating variations on the phrase ”first and last word in genre film-making”.\nWhich would be fine if you were doing a quick review or perhaps a blog post. But\nthere’s not enough meat on those bones to justify a paltry video-essay, never\nmind a 40 minute project comprised of dozens of interviewees!\n\nWhat’s worse is that, over the course of the piece, alternate readings are never\neven hinted at, giving it a very narrow view. This is partly because the talking\nheads are all interchangeable, with comparable interests and matching opinions.\nConsequently, they all approach the material from the same, bland position.\nThere’s no contrast to the discussion here. No variety. No back and forth. Just\npeople rabbiting on in circles about how much they love a 40 year-old movie.\n\nGiven that none of the presenters actually worked on Halloween, you would think\nthat they’d at least have interesting takes to make their commentary worth\nlistening to. But they don’t! They just offer banal praise of every facet of the\nfilm-making, like they’re dutifully ticking off all the Oscar categories or\nsomething.\n\n”The acting is great. And the directing is great. And the cinematography is\ngreat. And the production design is great. And the music is great. And the best\nanimated film is great!’ If you want to simulate the experience of watching For\nthe Love of the Boogeyman, simply copy and paste that quote about 200 times and\nyou’ll get the picture.\n\nIt’s just a surface-level appraisal that only serves to endorse a\npre-established consensus.

With notes by their side, they will readily launch into an impassioned sermon; expounding upon the film’s merit as a cinematic milestone and waxing poetic about everything from its economic use of lighting, to its meticulous framing and atmospheric score.<br><br>Indeed, there’s no shortage of people lining up to feleate Carpenter’s iconic masterwork. I myself wrote a particularly conceited essay about it at University, despite being unable to formulate a remotely compelling argument. I just ended up reiterating what countless others had already articulated before me and ultimately failed to say anything more insightful than ”that Michael Myers is well creepy!’<br><br>Unfortunately, a similar critique can be leveled at <strong>For the Love of the Boogeyman,</strong> a sycophantic documentary that tellingly markets itself as being made ‘by fans and for the fans”. Translation: ”it’s a fawning circle-jerk, with little-to-no substance and a startling lack of fresh perspective”.  So in that sense, it is strikingly reminiscent of my flimsy uni assignment, only much longer and with less uses of the word ”thus”.<br><br>You see, there’s no illuminating analysis to speak of here, just people repeating variations on the phrase ”first and last word in genre film-making”. Which would be fine if you were doing a quick review or perhaps a blog post. But there’s not enough meat on those bones to justify a paltry video-essay, never mind a 40 minute project comprised of dozens of interviewees!<br><br>What’s worse is that, over the course of the piece, alternate readings are never even hinted at, giving it a very narrow view. This is partly because the talking heads are all interchangeable, with comparable interests and matching opinions. Consequently, they all approach the material from the same, bland position. There’s no contrast to the discussion here. No variety. No back and forth. Just people rabbiting on in circles about how much they love a 40 year-old movie.<br><br>Given that none of the presenters actually worked on <strong>Halloween</strong>, you would think that they’d at least have interesting takes to make their commentary worth listening to. But they don’t! They just offer banal praise of every facet of the film-making, like they’re dutifully ticking off all the Oscar categories or something.<br><br>”The acting is great. And the directing is great. And the cinematography is great. And the production design is great. And the music is great. And the best animated film is great!’ If you want to simulate the experience of watching <strong>For the Love of the Boogeyman</strong>, simply copy and paste that quote about 200 times and you’ll get the picture.<br><br>It’s just a surface-level appraisal that only serves to endorse a pre-established consensus. No one needs to be told that <strong>Halloween</strong> is a fantastic movie, that’s pretty well cemented by now. If that’s all you’ve got to say, then your project has more in common with an episode of Collider Movie Talk than it does with an actual documentary.</p><p>Although this shortcoming is disappointing, it isn’t necessarily a deal-breaker.<br>After all, it can be nice to listen to people talk passionately about something they love, even if they don’t have anything especially original to contribute.

If all these elements\nconverge, then you should have no trouble competing with high-profile franchises\nand comic-book adaptations.\n\nWhannel clearly appreciates this, as each of his projects has been made on a\nshoestring budget. Moreover, whilst his output hasn’t been universally great, he\nhas consistently shown that he is a competent pair of hands and a dependable\nmoney-maker to boot. Because of this aptitude for working cheap, he has now\ngarnered enough industry cred to pursue whatever zany passion project takes his\nfancy.\n\nWhich brings us to the writer-turned-director’s latest offering, Upgrade. A\ngenre blending, cyberpunk, revenge flick, this is something that Whannel has\nbeen developing for years and like all of his previous work it has generated a\nlot of buzz despite its relatively humble origins (the estimated budget is\nsomewhere around the $5 million mark, which probably wouldn’t cover the catering\nfor most blockbusters). Praised for its intriguing premise and stylised\nhyper-violence, the film has already established a cult following, with many\npundits suggesting that it puts its more expensive peers to shame.\n\nNow- two months after its US release- Upgrade is debuting overseas, which means\nthat the rest of the world can finally jump aboard the hype train. But is the\nunassuming thriller really worth all the pomp and circumstance?\n\n\nSet in a future that is just around the corner, the film focuses on Grey (Logan\nMarshall-Green), a technophobe who has the misfortune of living in a society\ncompletely dominated by computers. Law enforcement is reliant upon drone\nsurveillance, smart houses take care of their own upkeep and even recreational\ndrug use has been supplanted by an addiction to VR. Everything is ostensibly\nsmoother and more convenient, yet Grey remains ever-sceptical and yearns for the\ngolden age of vinyl records, analogue devices and vehicles that require actual\nhuman drivers.\n\nOne day, after refurbishing an old car for a famous tech guru, Grey is treated\nto a showcase of the inventor’s latest creation; an AI chip named STEM. The\nscientist excitedly explains that the revolutionary implant can be inserted into\na person’s body to serve as a kind of secondary brain, giving the recipient\nenhanced motor skills, heightened agility and even increased intelligence. Of\ncourse, Grey is characteristically cynical about this and suggests that mankind\ndoesn’t really need such an upgrade.\n\nThis attitude changes however, when a fateful car accident leaves both Grey and\nhis wife susceptible to violent criminals. In an ensuing attack, the former is\nleft paralysed from the waist down and the latter is tragically killed.\n\nDetermined to track down his mysterious assailants, the bereaved husband\nabandons his old-fashioned ideals and volunteers as a Guinea pig for STEM, in\nthe hope that he can regain his ability to walk and get revenge. In the process,\nhe finds that he is not only restored to his original condition, but that he has\neven been augmented with incredible new skills. Now armed with superhuman\nsenses, a proficiency in martial arts and the capacity to switch off his pain\nreceptors, Grey decides to find his wife’s killers and assassinate them in\nincreasingly gory ways.\n\nRight off the bat, it’s fair to say that the premise is absolutely terrific,\nlike Death Wish crossed with a particularly good episode of Black Mirror. Yet\nthat only gives you a rough idea of what’s in store and to spoil the interesting\ntwists would be a disservice to Whannel’s sharp writing and inventive\nstorytelling.\n\nSure the surface-level gist of ‘’spouse-on-a quest-for-revenge’’ has been\ntrotted out a thousand times before in cinema, but here it’s all being presented\nwith a fresh coat of cybernetic-enhanced paint. After all, the movie’s core\ngimmick changes everything from how the investigation scenes play out, to how\nthe protagonist conceals his vigilantism from the police.\n\nBest of all though is how the idea affects the action sequences, which are all\nexpertly shot, masterfully choreographed and dizzyingly energetic. To give you a\nflavour of what makes these moments so special, Grey can hand over total control\nto STEM whenever he is faced with confrontation. Once the AI takes the wheel in\nthese scenarios, then our hero is transformed into a perfect killing machine,\ncapable of mesmerising acrobatics, astonishing brutality and predicting his\nopponent’s next move with the utmost accuracy.\n\nAs is to be expected, the resultant fights are pleasingly ferocious, if a little\ninfrequent and too short (the slow pacing is a bit of an issue). They are also\nstrangely funny as well, because STEM is unable to influence anything above\nGrey’s neck, and so the system has to manually move his head out of the way to\ndodge incoming blows. This makes for a unique visual, reminiscent of something\nfrom a slapstick cartoon. It’s also amusing to see the squeamish hero forced\ninto the role of a bemused observer, powerless as his own independently limbs\nflail around and cause all kinds of mayhem.\n\nWith these enjoyably kinetic scenes, Whannel demonstrates that a low-budget\nneedn’t be an obstacle to creativity and he also gives Marshall-Green a proper\nopportunity to show off his surprising comedic muscles. On that note, the\nactor’s animated depiction of a man constantly amazed by his own actions injects\nwelcome levity into a character that could otherwise be quite dour and\nunlikeable. That being said, he’s still very good at carrying the film through\nits more emotional beats when the need arises.\n\nElsewhere, every of other aspect of Upgrade is spot on. The believable sci-fi\nsetting is remarkably well-thought out and realistic. There are no jetpacks, no\nflying cars, or spaceships, just tiny little details like surgeons who use X-ray\ncontact lenses to perform operations.\n\nThis is a smart decision on the part of the screenwriter, as the refreshingly\ngrounded approach allows the film to tackle some fairly ambitious themes in its\nsecond half, examining humanity’s dependence on technology and whether or not we\nare making ourselves obsolete. In fact, as the film moves towards its climax, it\nbecomes less concerned with set-pieces and instead dedicates itself to a more\ncerebral breed of science-fiction.\n\nIt then all culminates in a darkly shocking ending that will stay with you for\ndays. In this sense, it’s a rare film that actually disguises its intelligence\nand demonstrates that being clever and being fun don’t have to be mutually\nexclusive concepts.","html":"<p>As the mastermind behind several modestly-funded hits, like <strong>Insidious</strong> and the early <strong>Saw</strong> movies, Leigh Whannel has repeatedly proven that you don’t need the resources of a Hollywood Blockbuster in order to thrill audiences.<br><br>Instead, all you need is a strong idea, a little ingenuity and some talented colleagues to help bring your vision to the screen.

It was as if the\ndevelopers had a pathological compulsion to please and were therefore willing to\nsay anything in order to keep their fanbase happy.\n\n\nIndeed, IIIFonic forecast- amongst other things- new playable characters, the\nability to weapon swap, various balancing tweaks, Jason X content, and a revised\npunishment for rage quitters (more on that later). Oh, and they also vowed to\nfinally introduce dedicated servers, along with a proper single-player mode as\nwell.\n\nThis ambition cannot be faulted and it’s abundantly clear that the developers\nreally do care about their product. In fact, their tendency to over-hype things\nis of the more affable, Peter Molyneux variety, in the sense that it stems from\nmisguided passion and blind optimism, rather than conscious deception. Having\nsaid that, they have still dug themselves into a bit of hole. Earnest intent\naside, they are selling a product, which means that they should appropriately\nmanage expectations, instead of stoke them up to 11.\n\nAfter all, because of the team’s inability to simply stop announcing things,\nthere is now a massive anticipation associated with the new patch. It certainty\nhas an an awful lot to deliver on, perhaps too much, because as it stands, there\nare certain things conspicuously missing here (most notably: those dedicated\nservers!). Moreover, the content that has been included is far from refined.\n\nWhilst the minor improvements- i.e.balancing adjustments; revamped animations\nand cosmetic upgrades- are all fine, the meatier additions leave something to be\ndesired.\n\nIntroducing the Single-Player Challenges\n\n\nIn particular, the new single-player mode is a complete mess. Which is a shame,\ngiven that A) its absence has long been a sticking point for many critics and B)\nthe gameplay foundations are perfectly solid. Alas, as is becoming a recurring\ntheme with Friday the 13th, whilst everything is fantastic on paper, the\ntechnical execution is disappointingly lacking.\n\nThe new mode is kind of reminiscent of a bargain-basement Hitman, in which you\ntake control of Jason and are tasked with picking off a group of typically\namorous teens in either stealthy or creative ways. In total, there’s only 10\nmissions to sink your teeth into, but to incentivise further replay the\ndevelopers have included a litany of extra trials, some of which are mutually\nexclusive. This means that completionists will have to do the whole thing\nmultiple times if they want to 100% it.\n\nEach map has 3 standard ”skulls”: one for ensuring that there are no survivors;\none for doing so whilst remaining undetected, and one for meeting an arbitrary\nscore target. Meanwhile, there are also bespoke objectives tailored to each\nlevel, ranging from ”murder the designated teen in a specific way”, to ”ensure\nthat no one reaches an allocated landmark”. As aforementioned, you can’t always\ndo these things simultaneously, or even in a clean attempt. Therefore if you\nwant to meet all of the requirements in a given scenario, you’ll need to\nre-experience it several times.\n\nThe Good Bits\n\n\nOn the surface, these missions could be fun, given that they are building upon\ntried-and-tested mechanics for an entirely new experience. This should make for\na nice change of pace from the multiplayer, as you get far more opportunity to\nbe tactical with your approach.  You’re not working against the clock to hunt\ndown knowing victims anymore, instead you’re dealing with unsuspecting cattle in\nmuch more contained venues. This means that you’re no longer playing an\nexpansive game of hide-and-seek and thus have greater scope to experiment and\nplay around.\n\nThere’s plenty of fan-service thrown into the mix as well, with scenes\nfastidiously recreated from the films. There’s a meticulous attention to detail\nin the environments, dialogue is lifted directly from the source material and\nclassic kills are replicated in all their outlandish glory. Being able to homage\nthe entire climax of The Final Chapter, or pull off the famous speargun kill\nfrom Friday the 13th: Part 3, is doubtlessly going to thrill any devotee of the\nfranchise.\n\nSpeaking of which, the plethora of new fatalities is easily the highlight of\nthis particular offering. Figuring out where they are and how to execute them is\na real treat, and you can tell that the devious think tank over at IIIFonic had\na blast devising them.\n\nAt its best, the new campaign successfully taps into the sinister, power fantasy\nappeal of Friday the 13th. Role-playing as an unstoppable killing machine,\nstalking your would-be victims from the shadows and then perfectly executing\nyour fiendish plan is an exhilarating process.\n\nOr at least that’s true at the beginning, but the fun rapidly dissipates.\n\nThe Negatives\n\nAs with the earlier iterations of Friday’s multiplayer, the novelty of this solo\nexperience is quickly undermined by just how frustrating, janky and\nfundamentally broken it is. The performance is wildly unstable, the AI behaviour\nis erratic and difficult-to-gauge and glitches are ludicrously rampant, along\nwith persistent frame-rate drops and recurring crashes. Even the controls have\nsomehow been botched, despite the fact that they’re identical to the existing\nones. In particular, the interact button proves to be a fickle mistress, often\nneglecting to carry out its duties, presumably out of sheer contempt for the\nplayer.\n\nWhen all of these problems converge – and they regularly do – then you’re\neffectively presented with a Kobayashi Maru situation, i.e: a true no-win\nscenario. The game insists that you are at fault, either because someone got\naway or because you were spotted. But make no mistake, you didn’t fail it. It \nfailed you.\n\nYou’re not to blame if the command prompts aren’t responding, or if a door\nrefuses to open. Nor can you help it if a counsellor never arrives because they\ngot stuck on a rock. Likewise, if divine Providence has intervened to save Chad\nby teleporting him halfway across the fucking map, then that shouldn’t reflect\nbadly on you. The game did not uphold its end of the bargain. It ceased to\nfunction and it will do so many, many times.\n\nThis wouldn’t be so grating, were it not for the fact that every single time you\nrestart a level, you are forced to endure the exact same, unskippable cut scene.\nAs a result, if you are having a notably tough time with a challenge (or if the\ngame unaccountably freezes on you) then you’ll have to endure the opening\ncut-scene on an endless loop and it wont be long before you’re capable of\nreciting the dialogue in its entirety.\n\nFor instance, take this little exchange from Chapter 10:\n\n> Tiffany: Mind if I dance with him?\nVanessa: Actually, I’m gonna take a swim. Something stinks in here.\nTiffany: Hey big stuff, show me your moves?\nKenny: Sure Milady.\n\nTo clarify, I didn’t have to look that up. This scene has been committed to\nmemory, etched onto the very matter of my brain, after only a single play\nsession. That would be excruciating enough if it was my fault, but\nmore-often-than-not the restart happened when the game just shit itself and\ndecided to punish me for it!\n\nWhat’s even worse is that sometimes these openings (which I have to stress are \nunskippable) don’t even play properly. On both the PS4 and Xbox One versions,\nthere is a specific intro that has a good chance of crashing the game and it was\nnot uncommon for me to see clones of NPCs materialise in the middle of a\ncut-scene.\n\nAnd as for the defective AI, that’s possibly the biggest ball-ache of all. They\ncan’t seem to decide if they’re working to a preordained path, or if they’re\ninstead improvising their behaviour. I think it’s supposed to be the former, but\nit doesn’t always work like that, as if we’re in Westworld or something and the\ncharacters are rebelling against their narrative.\n\n\nThis is highly disruptive to the gameplay, because achieving the perfect\nstealth-run requires you to know exactly where the NPCs go to isolate themselves\nand exactly when they do it. Everything needs to be in precise synchronicity for\nthis, otherwise all your planning goes down the drain. Even a split second going\namiss can make the difference between a kill and a missed opportunity, or\nbetween a character facing one direction and them facing another, so they need\nto be regimented!\n\nAdmittedly, there are many stealth games out there that use unscripted AI and\ndon’t have things like designated patrol routes (Metal Gear Solid V, Alien\nIsolation). In those games, you obviously can’t rely on set patterns and have to\nadapt to situations as they unfold. However if that’s the case, then the level\ndesign should properly account for this off-the-cuff dynamic.\n\nYet that’s not how it works in Friday the 13th, and so you can never be certain\nhow to proceed.  You can’t predict if the AI will suddenly verge from the path\nthat it has invariably taken in every other instance. Sure, Eric is programmed\nto go outside after he’s been rejected by Tiffany, but the one time that you\nprepare for him doing this will be the one time that he inexplicably remains\ninside.\n\nHell, the NPC behaviour is so volatile that on one occasion a wheelchair-bound\ncharacter miraculously recovered and went for a fucking moonlight stroll!\n\nAnd the bloody Salt Mines\n\n\nThose single-player challenges might be blatantly unfinished, but at least you\ncan ignore them and it wont have much of an impact on the rest of the game. The\n”Salt Mines [http://www.f13game.com/news/welcome-to-the-salt-mines/]” on the\nother hand, are a much more dangerous proposition. Conceived as a deterrent to\nrage-quitters, this new system threatens to segregate any players who are deemed\nto be ”salty” by IIIFonic. In other words, it’s a method of shaming those who\nostensibly have a history of poor sportsmanship.\n\nAgain, this is theoretically viable and anywhere else it would be a welcome\nsolution to the problem of sore losers. But in a game as notoriously unreliable\nas Friday the 13th, it’s rather galling that they have the nerve to introduce\nthis. Yes, people are guilty of quitting matches early and I have no shame in\nadmitting to it myself. Why? Because the game practically dares me to.\n\nWhen the lag becomes unbearable, when cheaters are exploiting glaringly\nunaddressed bugs and when my character freezes in the middle of an animation\n(and thus become useless), then of course I’m going to quit. As a working adult\nwith real-life commitments, I don’t have the time to simply power through these\nbadly performing matches. I’m only going to stick around for the ones that work.\n\nFor the game to brand me as a ”salty”, simply because I refuse to put up with\nits shit, is just a step too far in my book. If a car habitually stalled every\ntime you tried to change gear, you wouldn’t grin and bear it. You’d get a new\ncar. And you wouldn’t expect the manufacturer to come out publicaly and\ncriticise your driving ability like a bunch of knobheads.\n\nSo, before you start condescending me about how’ ‘losing is a part of playing’,\nwhy don’t you get your product into an acceptable state first? Because until\nit’s fixed, I am going to continue leaving broken matches. And the day that I am\nsent to the salt mines for that crime, will be the day that I stop giving this\nmess a chance and put it away for good.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Free cosmetic additions, balancing tweaks and a new playable counsellor.\n+ Inventive deaths and references are enjoyable. \n+ Single Player Challenges are fun initally.\n\nCons:\n\n– Still no dedicated servers\n– Single Player feels rushed and annoying\n– Unskippable, recurring cut-scenes\n– Salt Mines are just a bad idea\n\nRating: 5/10","html":"<p>It’s only been a few months since the <a href=\"https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/02/video-game-review-friday-13th-game-january-update/\">last update</a> to <strong>Friday the 13th: The Game,</strong> but in that short space of time, the combined teams over at Gun Media and IIIFonic have been furiously making announcements, pledging new features at an absolutely manic rate.<br><br>They arguably got a little over-eager in this regard, with a level of promise-making seldom observed outside of national politics.

In fact, their tendency to over-hype things is of the more affable, Peter Molyneux variety, in the sense that it stems from misguided passion and blind optimism, rather than conscious deception.

Alas, as is becoming a recurring theme with <strong>Friday the 13th</strong>, whilst everything is fantastic on paper, the technical execution is disappointingly lacking.<br><br>The new mode is kind of reminiscent of a bargain-basement <strong>Hitman</strong>, in which you take control of Jason and are tasked with picking off a group of typically amorous teens in either stealthy or creative ways. In total, there’s only 10 missions to sink your teeth into, but to incentivise further replay the developers have included a litany of extra trials, some of which are mutually exclusive.

So please, exercise some\nviewerly discretion and heed my warning: stay well away from Gehenna: Where\nDeath Lives.\n\nIf you still insist on watching it, then I implore you to keep reading.  At\nleast that way you will be fully prepared for the galling tedium that’s to come…\n\nBefore going any further, I want to stress that this movie is not funny bad, or\neven fascinatingly inept. It’s just hard work. So if you decide to give it a\nshot, then don’t blame me if you have a thoroughly miserable time. Because this\nis nothing but turgid, uneventful claptrap; completely devoid of scares and\nentirely lacking in narrative coherence or basic entertainment value.\n\nLike me, you may have been lured in by the film’s promise of recognisable\ncharacter actors, like Doug Jones or Lance Henriksen. If that’s the case, then\nyou will be pissed to discover that their combined screen time is approximately\n180 seconds, with one them- quite literally – phoning in their performance from\nbehind a desk. To be crystal clear, this film is not the Doug Jones vehicle that\nthe poster is selling you. It doesn’t remotely hinge on one of his signature\ncreepy characters, he just happens to be in it for a solitary scene and then a\ncouple of insert shots thereafter. Still, apparently that’s enough to hang an\nentire marketing campaign on. Hmmm…\n\nYour justified sense of rage will doubtlessly swell further, when it turns out\nthat the actual leads of this rotting garbage pile are a bunch of clueless\namateurs, who deliver their lines so awkwardly that you’ll swear they’ve never\nhad to use vowels before.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the filmmakers presumably thought that lights were only\nfor high-falutin Oscar movies, and so elected to abandon them altogether. It\ncertainly feels that way, with some sequences being so needlessly dark that they\nmight as well be in a radio play for all the difference it would make. As a\nresult, the majority of your viewing experience will be spent hopelessly\nsquinting, trying to discern what the hell is happening on screen. Rest assured,\nit’s a waste of effort. Just save your eyesight for something that actually\ndeserves it.\n\nOh, and you will also be subjected to relentless attempts at ‘’psychological\nhorror’’, courtesy of a supernatural curse that only makes sense because every\ncharacter in the film has unaccountably suffered a recent bereavement. It’s\nthoroughly unclear what would actually happen them otherwise. I suppose the\ncurse would just skip them out?\n\nIt’s around this point that you will start to notice  that the movie is not only\nintolerably generic and dreadfully acted, but also oppressively stupid. This\nnotion will be later substantiated when a character wanders into a dimly lit\nroom and posits that it looks too similar to all of the others. Upon making this\nobservation, he inexplicably reasons that he must be stuck in some kind of\ntemporal loop.\n\nHe says this, despite the fact that bunkers aren’t exactly known for having\nvaried interior designs. In fact, it never once occurs to him that maybe the\nreason the rooms all look the same, is because they’re all dark, grey and empty.\nInstead of thinking in this way (you know, like a rational human being) he just\ninfers that the very fabric of reality is deteriorating around him! Granted, he\nis later proven right, but it still doesn’t change the fact that this was his\nfirst fucking assumption!\n\n\nTo be fair, characters will come to similarly groundless conclusions throughout\nthe movie, but after a while you’ll stop caring. You’re already long past trying\nto make sense of this nonsense. You just want it over with. So whenever someone\nmakes an out-of-nowhere remark, or formulates some kind of bizarre and\nunmotivated plan, you’ll just roll your eyes and mutter ‘’Fine. Whatever it\ntakes to get to the goddamn ending!’’\n\nSpeaking of which, as we approach that long-overdue climax (which involves a\ntwist so heavily telegraphed, that Mr. Magoo could see it coming), you’ll begin\nto feel a deep-seated anger. A hateful sensation. One that is festering\nsomewhere deep within your very being. If you’re wondering why you’re feeling\nthis way, it won’t be thanks to an opportune organ failure (which would be a\nsweet mercy), but because you’ve just realized that nothing in this movie is of\nany consequence whatsoever.\n\nIndeed, until the last couple of scenes, it’s all just people aimlessly\nwandering around in the dark. Evidently, this is all part of a calculated effort\nto stretch the runtime out to an arbitrary 100 minutes, when 80 would have\nclearly sufficed. Heck, even that’s being generous. There’s not enough material\nhere to justify a 15 minute short, never mind a full-length feature!\n\nAnd then as the credits begin to roll, it finally hits you. The eureka moment!\nAt long last, you understand. Understand why this has all been so stilted and\narduous. How could you have not seen it before? Gehenna: Where Death Lives is\nnot a film in the conventional sense! It is not designed to entertain, tell a\ncompelling story or transport its audience into another word. It has much\nloftier ambitions than that.\n\nThis isn’t a movie, it’s a statement! And that quote on the poster – it isn’t a\npromotional tagline. It’s a lesson. A cruel, painful lesson, one that you have\ngradually come to appreciate. You see it now too, don’t you? There are some\nfates worse than death.","html":"<p><strong>Gehenna: Where Death Lives</strong> doesn’t have much going for it, but it does boast one of the most fitting taglines in cinema history: ‘’Some fates are <em>much</em> worse than death’… Indeed.<br><br>For instance you could:</p><ul><li>Awaken underground, unable to see or breathe, prematurely entombed within a small wooden coffin.</li><li>Contract a debilitating wasting disease and slowly wither away as your loved ones watch-on in bewildered horror.</li><li>Suffer from the infamous ‘’locked in syndrome’’, with a looping series of infomercials playing on the TV in front of you.</li><li>Watch <strong>Gehenna: Where Death Lives.</strong></li></ul><p>Should you find yourself in the latter scenario, then there are very few people in this world who will be able to understand your pain. So please, exercise some viewerly discretion and heed my warning: stay well away from <strong>Gehenna: Where Death Lives</strong>.<br><br>If you still insist on watching it, then I implore you to keep reading.  At least that way you will be fully prepared for the galling tedium that’s to come…<br><br>Before going any further, I want to stress that this movie is not funny bad, or even fascinatingly inept. It’s just hard work. So if you decide to give it a shot, then don’t blame me if you have a thoroughly miserable time. Because this is nothing but turgid, uneventful claptrap; completely devoid of scares and entirely lacking in narrative coherence or <em>basic</em> entertainment value.<br><br>Like me, you may have been lured in by the film’s promise of recognisable character actors, like Doug Jones or Lance Henriksen. If that’s the case, then you will be pissed to discover that their combined screen time is approximately 180 seconds, with one them- quite literally – phoning in their performance from behind a desk. To be crystal clear, this film <em>is not</em> the Doug Jones vehicle that the poster is selling you. It doesn’t remotely hinge on one of his signature creepy characters, he just happens to be in it for a solitary scene and then a couple of insert shots thereafter. Still, apparently that’s enough to hang an entire marketing campaign on. Hmmm…<br><br>Your justified sense of rage will doubtlessly swell further, when it turns out that the actual leads of this rotting garbage pile are a bunch of clueless amateurs, who deliver their lines so awkwardly that you’ll swear they’ve never had to use vowels before.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2QQjKbPzv8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p><br>To make matters worse, the filmmakers presumably thought that lights were only for high-falutin Oscar movies, and so elected to abandon them altogether. It certainly feels that way, with some sequences being so needlessly dark that they might as well be in a radio play for all the difference it would make. As a result, the majority of your viewing experience will be spent hopelessly squinting, trying to discern what the hell is happening on screen. Rest assured, it’s a waste of effort. Just save your eyesight for something that actually deserves it.<br><br>Oh, and you will also be subjected to relentless attempts at ‘’psychological horror’’, courtesy of a supernatural curse that only makes sense because every character in the film has unaccountably suffered a recent bereavement. It’s thoroughly unclear what would actually happen them otherwise. I suppose the curse would just skip them out?<br><br>It’s around this point that you will start to notice  that the movie is not only intolerably generic and dreadfully acted, but also oppressively stupid. This notion will be later substantiated when a character wanders into a dimly lit room and posits that it looks too similar to all of the others. Upon making this observation, he inexplicably reasons that he <em>must</em> be stuck in some kind of temporal loop.<br><br>He says this, despite the fact that bunkers aren’t exactly known for having varied interior designs. In fact, it never once occurs to him that maybe the reason the rooms all look the same, is because they’re all dark, grey and empty. Instead of thinking in this way (you know, like a rational human being) he just infers that the very fabric of reality is deteriorating around him! Granted, he is later proven right, but it still doesn’t change the fact that this was his first fucking assumption!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/081K6430-1024x683.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><br>To be fair, characters will come to similarly groundless conclusions throughout the movie, but after a while you’ll stop caring. You’re already long past trying to make sense of this nonsense. You just want it over with. So whenever someone makes an out-of-nowhere remark, or formulates some kind of bizarre and unmotivated plan, you’ll just roll your eyes and mutter ‘’Fine. Whatever it takes to get to the goddamn ending!’’<br><br>Speaking of which, as we approach that long-overdue climax (which involves a twist so heavily telegraphed, that Mr. Magoo could see it coming), you’ll begin to feel a deep-seated anger. A hateful sensation. One that is festering somewhere <em>deep</em> within your very being. If you’re wondering why you’re feeling this way, it won’t be thanks to an opportune organ failure (which would be a sweet mercy), but because you’ve just realized that nothing in this movie is of any consequence whatsoever.<br><br>Indeed, until the last couple of scenes, it’s all just people aimlessly wandering around in the dark. Evidently, this is all part of a calculated effort to stretch the runtime out to an arbitrary 100 minutes, when 80 would have clearly sufficed. Heck, even that’s being generous. There’s not enough material here to justify a 15 minute short, never mind a full-length feature!<br><br>And then as the credits begin to roll, it finally hits you. The eureka moment! At long last, you understand. Understand why this has all been so stilted and arduous. How could you have not seen it before? <strong>Gehenna: Where Death Lives</strong> is not a film in the conventional sense! It is not designed to entertain, tell a compelling story or transport its audience into another word. It has much loftier ambitions than that.<br><br>This isn’t a movie, it’s a statement! And that quote on the poster – it isn’t a promotional tagline. It’s a lesson. A cruel, painful lesson, one that you have gradually come to appreciate. You see it now too, don’t you? There are some fates worse than death.</p>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-gehenna/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"c70e3c83-ed6a-4385-9d74-8b2a54a0dd48","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60354f1824de3c001c23ac0a","reading_time":4}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__6035520624de3c001c23ac77","title":"Review | A Quiet Place","slug":"review-a-quiet-place","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/quiet-place.jpg","excerpt":"While A Quiet Place manages to captivate with it's intriguing concept, it ultimately comes across as slightly toothless.","custom_excerpt":"While A Quiet Place manages to captivate with it's intriguing concept, it ultimately comes across as slightly toothless.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"23 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"02 May, 2018","updated_at_pretty":"23 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-23T19:05:42.000+00:00","published_at":"2018-05-02T19:06:00.000+01:00","updated_at":"2021-02-23T19:07:29.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harrison Abbott","slug":"harrisonabbot","bio":"Opinionated, Verbose and Generally Pedantic.

Most recent titles seem to fall into two similarly\nunsatisfying camps: personality free remakes of yesteryear’s successes, and\nthose with a more psychological inclination. Unfortunately psychological\nhorror’s meaning appears to have shifted from something that manages to get\nunder your skin and really creep you out to something that makes sudden loud\nnoises every now and then and has a creepy doll in it. Occasionally though,\nsomething good does manage to slip through the cracks, The Cabin in the Woods \nsprings to mind with it’s postmodern smarts and real unpredictability. However,\nit’s rare that the U.S nowadays can produce a clever, well constructed and\ngenuinely original horror film without having to wink at its audience\nironically.\n\nThankfuly, there is Adam Wingard who proved with his last effort You’re Next \nthat the old ways aren’t quite dead, doing for John Carpenter what Super 8 did\nfor Spielberg. With gleeful gore, a synthesizer lead soundtrack and a strong\nfemale protagonist, You’re Next didn’t so much provide anything new as it did\nreturn, with affection and sincerity, to how things used to be done. His follow\nup, The Guest, is also filled to the brim with that same genre know-how.\nHowever, it’s much harder to classify, in fact it seems to resist labeling\naltogether, even if it is set at Halloween and was screened at this year’s \nFrightfest. Not quite an action film, not quite a psychological thriller, not\nquite a slasher, the film is a mix of all of these and more (it even has a small\nelement of sci-fi) to create something that is hugely enjoyable.\n\nAt a lean 99 minutes, it also tells its story without unnecessary length. A\nnuclear-family, the Petersons, mourn the loss of their eldest son Caleb to the\nwar in Afghanistan, when one day an unexpected visitor shows up declaring that\nhe knew him. The soldier, David (Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens), is welcomed into\nthe house with open arms, whereupon he reveals that he made a promise to Caleb,\nto check on his family and make sure that they were okay. He proceeds to do so\nwith extreme dedication: helping youngest child Luke defend himself from\nbullies, aiding Luke’s Sister Anna with her relationship problems and so on.\nSeemingly adored by everyone, David continues to live as a house-guest in the\nPeterson’s home, however it eventually becomes apparent that he is not who he\nseems to be. Revealing too much more would spoil the fun, but it is always quite\nclear where things are heading.\n\nMost of the attention will focus on Steven’s electrifying performance and\nrightly so. Remarkably charismatic, even when you know of his lethal intentions,\nit’s hard to side against the supremely polite, overly courteous psychopath.\nSteven’s succeeds in going back and forth between ultimate nice guy and ultimate\nbad guy in the blink of an eye, his manner not changing a beat when he does so,\nmaking the transition all the more threatening. When he informs someone he is\ngoing to kill them with the same inflection with which he gratefully accepts the\noffer of a beer, it prompts an uneasy chuckle.\n\nSteven’s winning charisma may be what captures the broader audience’s attention,\nbut for genre aficionados it’s Wingard’s reverence for the old school that will\nreally impress. His understanding of the era he’s throwing back to transcends\nthe mere box ticking of well known conventions. We all know the narrative\nclichés and tropes, but Wingard has an eye for the little things, the John\nCarpenter-esque music, the flamboyant lighting, the abrupt scene transitions,\nthe nature of the denouncement – even the font of the title text is spot on! If\nit wasn’t for the contemporary post-911 concerns and references to laptops and\nMobile phones, you’d swear blindly that this was a product of the 1980s. It’s\nalmost a shame that you won’t be able to rent it on VHS, it seems purpose built\nfor it.\n\nMixed with these charming, retro details is witty writing, well judged comedy,\nterrific direction and a fantastic final act, if anything lets it down, it’s the\ntameness of the violence (all the more disappointing after an early bar fight\nwhich suggests things could go entirely the other way). Nevertheless with a true\nold school spirit and a captivating central performance, The Guest is a welcome\nshot in the arm for the horror genre…. if indeed it even is a horror film.","html":"<p>It hardly needs pointing out that mainstream American horror is in something of a rut at the moment.

However, it’s rare that the U.S nowadays can produce a clever, well constructed and genuinely original horror film without having to wink at its audience ironically.<br><br>Thankfuly, there is Adam Wingard who proved with his last effort <em>You’re Next</em> that the old ways aren’t quite dead, doing for John Carpenter what <em>Super 8</em> did for Spielberg. With gleeful gore, a synthesizer lead soundtrack and a strong female protagonist, <em>You’re Next</em> didn’t so much provide anything new as it did return, with affection and sincerity, to how things used to be done. His follow up, <em>The Guest,</em> is also filled to the brim with that same genre know-how. However, it’s much harder to classify, in fact it seems to resist labeling altogether, even if it is set at Halloween and was screened at this year’s <em>Frightfest</em>. Not quite an action film, not quite a psychological thriller, not quite a slasher, the film is a mix of all of these and more (it even has a small element of sci-fi) to create something that is hugely enjoyable.<br><br>At a lean 99 minutes, it also tells its story without unnecessary length. A nuclear-family, the Petersons, mourn the loss of their eldest son Caleb to the war in Afghanistan, when one day an unexpected visitor shows up declaring that he knew him. The soldier, David (Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens), is welcomed into the house with open arms, whereupon he reveals that he made a promise to Caleb, to check on his family and make sure that they were okay. He proceeds to do so with extreme dedication: helping youngest child Luke defend himself from bullies, aiding Luke’s Sister Anna with her relationship problems and so on. Seemingly adored by everyone, David continues to live as a house-guest in the Peterson’s home, however it eventually becomes apparent that he is not who he seems to be. Revealing too much more would spoil the fun, but it is always quite clear where things are heading.<br><br>Most of the attention will focus on Steven’s electrifying performance and rightly so. Remarkably charismatic, even when you know of his lethal intentions, it’s hard to side against the supremely polite, overly courteous psychopath. Steven’s succeeds in going back and forth between ultimate nice guy and ultimate bad guy in the blink of an eye, his manner not changing a beat when he does so, making the transition all the more threatening. When he informs someone he is going to kill them with the same inflection with which he gratefully accepts the offer of a beer, it prompts an uneasy chuckle.<br><br>Steven’s winning charisma may be what captures the broader audience’s attention, but for genre aficionados it’s Wingard’s reverence for the old school that will really impress. His understanding of the era he’s throwing back to transcends the mere box ticking of well known conventions. We all know the narrative clichés and tropes, but Wingard has an eye for the little things, the John Carpenter-esque music, the flamboyant lighting, the abrupt scene transitions, the nature of the denouncement – even the font of the title text is spot on! If it wasn’t for the contemporary post-911 concerns and references to laptops and Mobile phones, you’d swear blindly that this was a product of the 1980s. It’s almost a shame that you won’t be able to rent it on VHS, it seems purpose built for it.<br><br>Mixed with these charming, retro details is witty writing, well judged comedy, terrific direction and a fantastic final act, if anything lets it down, it’s the tameness of the violence (all the more disappointing after an early bar fight which suggests things could go entirely the other way). Nevertheless with a true old school spirit and a captivating central performance, <em>The Guest</em> is a welcome shot in the arm for the horror genre…. if indeed it even is a horror film.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtV3L3IuTkA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>","url":"https://reelopinions.herokuapp.com/review-the-guest/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"7f013e61-ce59-4c12-ba91-122633aee146","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"602ce2841f83ac001cfcb8b9","reading_time":3}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__602aa6562e2680001c44b1b6","title":"What exactly is \"Real Horror\"?","slug":"what-is-real-horror","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault15.jpg","excerpt":"A semi-rant, semi-reasoned explanation, of why nothing can be objectively scary... except Adam Sandler films.","custom_excerpt":"A semi-rant, semi-reasoned explanation, of why nothing can be objectively scary... except Adam Sandler films.","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"15 February, 2021","published_at_pretty":"27 December, 2014","updated_at_pretty":"15 February, 2021","created_at":"2021-02-15T16:50:30.000+00:00","published_at":"2014-12-27T16:50:00.000+00:00","updated_at":"2021-02-15T16:54:02.000+00:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"A look at the varying definitions of what horror is.","og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Harrison Abbott","slug":"harrisonabbot","bio":"Opinionated, Verbose and Generally Pedantic.

There's only a few questions just because we had limited time and there was translation back and forth. But yeah, give it a read if you're interested in more.<br><br>Mary the Witch's Flower is the first film by Studio Ponoc; meaning "midnight" or "a brand new day" as a majority are staff that have left Studio Ghibli to start their own company. Yonebayashi, the director, he originally did ‘When Marnie Was There’ and ‘The Secret Life of Arietty’, and basically when Studio Ghibli started shutting now and it’s masters announced they were no longer producing feature films, its younger staff thought: "Well... We still want to do stuff. We'd like to have jobs" and so they have set off on their own ways.<br><br>There is a quote from the original book that they cited a lot in a lot of the interview materials  where Mary says at one point: "I want to open this door but I want to open it without using magic no matter how long that takes" and that is kind of how they've cited their mindset going into this film. They wanted a character that liked magic, but then realized at the end of it that they no longer needed magic to be who they were. That is the context that they've seen for moving on from the magic of Studio Ghibli.<br><br>I understand that concept, however I think that they don't push far enough with this film to be completely separate from the past.<br><br>I also think there's something with that statement where you say "We don't want magic" – as it’s disregarding that that is the aspect most people like about Studio Ghibli? They like that it's got this magical element to it, this fantasy, this wonder, and saying we want to leave the magic of Studio Ghibili behind -- I know that they're  highlighting its reputation moreso than the actual style of the films, because this is very much a continuation of that. But it's a touchstone that I think highlights a few of the flaws going into the final product.<br><br>Mary and the Witch's Flower is based on the English novel The Little Broomstick. Mary has moved to live with her elderly aunt in the countryside and it's summer so she's just waiting to start school in this new area. So she's left in the house with just elderly people and nothing to really do and so she's very bored and she slowly starts exploring the nearby countryside. While doing that she follows some cats finds the magical witch's flower and a broomstick. By crushing one of the flower’s berries she gains magical powers for those 24 hours and the broom sets off and takes her away to Endor College where she finds a magical headmistress and plots happens, as it tends to do sometimes.<br><br>As films go it's not particularly flawed in any way, it's just missing that magic that they wanted to kind of step away from. Mary feels like a compilation of all the kind of stubborn Ghibili girls rolled into one, but with nothing in particular defining her. It's also a very similar plot of being whisked away to a magical building run by a kind of creepy crony old woman who uses magic to control the girl at several times and it ultimately wraps into a story of Technology versus nature. So to say this is a film that is entirely branching out from what's happened before would be… untruthful.<br><br>They have also said in all the promotional materials that they didn't deliberately go out to try and make a film that would be popular and make money - they wanted to make something that they wanted to make; and again I think, is that really true? Because, granted, the director’s previous two books that he's adapted into films are English fantasy novels by female writers around the same era, So that's definitely in his MO, but the past two films were definitely smaller in scale and a lot more focused on human drama and emotions. Whereas this is on a much larger scale and just seems to skim over a lot of the human element of the film.<br><br>As you could probably see in the trailer obviously the animation is just top-notch all the way through. I think they've put a majority of the kind of flourishes in the trailer so you've probably already seen it on this video but there are some really amazingly animated sections.<br><br>I don't know why I've left off this review so long because I saw it a while ago and when I think back to it I just think that there wasn't that much to remember about it. Like I said the characters were kind of cut-out, the plot was... I wouldn't venture to say predictable but it wasn't particularly imaginative and the moments where the film was being imaginative it seemed to really brush over to get back to a plot that I wasn't that interested in. In all of the interviews they mentioned how passionate they were about this project and I'd watched the behind-the-scenes documentary on the amount of work that they did put into it and the amount of late nights - but watching the final film you don't feel that. You don't feel the passion.<br><br>You don't feel like this is a story that he really wants to tell. It feels like the story that the studio wants to tell to get a really good first start and I can understand that because starting a studio, especially a high quality animation feature film studio, is just--  it's a very very risky move. It just is. I'm not saying that they don't love animation, obviously they love animation that's why they are wanting to make this, but they need to set a good foundation for that company and I completely understand that but I just think that it means that whatever Ponoc come out with next potentially, or maybe the film after that, if they continue to be successful I just think that this will be looked back on as the safe foundation from which they tried to build something new.<br><br>I can't hate the film for that. But it doesn't mean I have to love it or particularly like it. I don't think there was much to watch back on. I think that if you maybe have a kid, they might enjoy it. Just a kid that loves fantasy in particular But for adults--  like adults can re-watch a lot of the classic Ghibili films and still feel that wonder of it and the fun. Personally I just don't think there was enough of that here to really get me excited about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Review | The Guest]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Guest is a welcome shot in the arm for the horror genre…. if indeed it even is a horror film.]]></description><link>http://reelopinions.com/review-the-guest/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__602ce2841f83ac001cfcb8b9</guid><category><![CDATA[Review]]></category><category><![CDATA[Horror]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Harrison Abbott]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 09:31:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault5.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault5.jpg" alt="Review | The Guest"/><p>It hardly needs pointing out that mainstream American horror is in something of a rut at the moment. Most recent titles seem to fall into two similarly unsatisfying camps: personality free remakes of yesteryear’s successes, and those with a more psychological inclination. Unfortunately psychological horror’s meaning appears to have shifted from <em>something that manages to get under your skin and really creep you out</em> to <em>something that makes sudden loud noises every now and then and has a creepy doll in it</em>. Occasionally though, something good does manage to slip through the cracks, <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em> springs to mind with it’s postmodern smarts and real unpredictability. However, it’s rare that the U.S nowadays can produce a clever, well constructed and genuinely original horror film without having to wink at its audience ironically.<br><br>Thankfuly, there is Adam Wingard who proved with his last effort <em>You’re Next</em> that the old ways aren’t quite dead, doing for John Carpenter what <em>Super 8</em> did for Spielberg. With gleeful gore, a synthesizer lead soundtrack and a strong female protagonist, <em>You’re Next</em> didn’t so much provide anything new as it did return, with affection and sincerity, to how things used to be done. His follow up, <em>The Guest,</em> is also filled to the brim with that same genre know-how. However, it’s much harder to classify, in fact it seems to resist labeling altogether, even if it is set at Halloween and was screened at this year’s <em>Frightfest</em>. Not quite an action film, not quite a psychological thriller, not quite a slasher, the film is a mix of all of these and more (it even has a small element of sci-fi) to create something that is hugely enjoyable.<br><br>At a lean 99 minutes, it also tells its story without unnecessary length. A nuclear-family, the Petersons, mourn the loss of their eldest son Caleb to the war in Afghanistan, when one day an unexpected visitor shows up declaring that he knew him. The soldier, David (Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens), is welcomed into the house with open arms, whereupon he reveals that he made a promise to Caleb, to check on his family and make sure that they were okay. He proceeds to do so with extreme dedication: helping youngest child Luke defend himself from bullies, aiding Luke’s Sister Anna with her relationship problems and so on. Seemingly adored by everyone, David continues to live as a house-guest in the Peterson’s home, however it eventually becomes apparent that he is not who he seems to be. Revealing too much more would spoil the fun, but it is always quite clear where things are heading.<br><br>Most of the attention will focus on Steven’s electrifying performance and rightly so. Remarkably charismatic, even when you know of his lethal intentions, it’s hard to side against the supremely polite, overly courteous psychopath. Steven’s succeeds in going back and forth between ultimate nice guy and ultimate bad guy in the blink of an eye, his manner not changing a beat when he does so, making the transition all the more threatening. When he informs someone he is going to kill them with the same inflection with which he gratefully accepts the offer of a beer, it prompts an uneasy chuckle.<br><br>Steven’s winning charisma may be what captures the broader audience’s attention, but for genre aficionados it’s Wingard’s reverence for the old school that will really impress. His understanding of the era he’s throwing back to transcends the mere box ticking of well known conventions. We all know the narrative clichés and tropes, but Wingard has an eye for the little things, the John Carpenter-esque music, the flamboyant lighting, the abrupt scene transitions, the nature of the denouncement – even the font of the title text is spot on! If it wasn’t for the contemporary post-911 concerns and references to laptops and Mobile phones, you’d swear blindly that this was a product of the 1980s. It’s almost a shame that you won’t be able to rent it on VHS, it seems purpose built for it.<br><br>Mixed with these charming, retro details is witty writing, well judged comedy, terrific direction and a fantastic final act, if anything lets it down, it’s the tameness of the violence (all the more disappointing after an early bar fight which suggests things could go entirely the other way). Nevertheless with a true old school spirit and a captivating central performance, <em>The Guest</em> is a welcome shot in the arm for the horror genre…. if indeed it even is a horror film.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtV3L3IuTkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""/></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What exactly is "Real Horror"?]]></title><description><![CDATA[A semi-rant, semi-reasoned explanation, of why nothing can be objectively scary... except Adam Sandler films.]]></description><link>http://reelopinions.com/what-is-real-horror/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__602aa6562e2680001c44b1b6</guid><category><![CDATA[Horror]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Harrison Abbott]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2014 16:50:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault15.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault15.jpg" alt="What exactly is &quot;Real Horror&quot;?"/><p>A semi-rant, semi-reasoned explanation, of why nothing can be objectively scary... except Adam Sandler films.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Director Grégory Levasseur isn’t in the mood to argue over mere technicalities, he had bigger concerns on his mind, whether or not his audience could see ANYTHING AT ALL ON SCREEN didn’t matter. They’d got through it so far without worrying about it. No. His mind was elsewhere. For a start, he’s on the final day of shooting and has yet to acquire a script. So far he and the crew have been working with some crayon jottings they found on a napkin at a Burger King. “It’ll do” he shrugged when setting up the camera on day one, and it had been the production ethos ever since. But maybe now was the time to make a change. Dialogue such as “We’re like food in a bowl” and “Can you stop being Archaeologists for 5 minutes and act like human beings!?” can only get you so far.<br><br>He mulls on this thought. Plays with it, loses himself in it. Then out of the perpetual dessert  ahead the assistant director approaches, asks him why  they’re doing a wide shot featuring all of the cast in this found footage movie. Oh damn, found footage, he had forgot. Had he made this error more than once? Days were starting to blur together, nothing was certain anymore. The A.D asks if this means they’ll have to get rid of that shot where the camera tracks up into space and looks down on earth. So he had forgotten before. Oh well.<br><br>“Are you kidding? That’ll take… effort”.<br><br>No. He has more pressing matters to attend to. The visual effects people are on the phone asking if he really wants his monsters to look like the rabbit creatures from the 2002 <em>Scooby Doo</em> movie. Amateurs. Why can’t they understand his dream? Out here, a man has to come to terms with who he really is. Who is Levasseur? A visionary. They might not see that now. But they will. They will. He looks up to the sky. There are no clouds. Just the vast expanse of infinite space. No one to tell them what to do. Here everything plays by his rules. He returns his gaze down, walks onto set.<br><br>Let’s just get this over with. The heat is baring down too hard. Overwhelmed by the stress of the job, the pressure, it’s all too much. One final push. Then home.<br><br>“And action!” His mouth makes the sound, but his mind doesn’t comprehend the words. Then it begins. Indistinct noises. Confused inept actors running around in the dark. He doesn’t listen. Everything around him is a blur. Eventually the murmuring stops.<br><br>“CUT!”<br><br>“That’s a wrap.”<br><br>Sighs of relief. People talk at him. Pay cheques are taken. Flights home are boarded. A trailer is cut. Distribution. Exhibition. Ticket’s purchased. Projection. Cinema dies a little.<br><br>The Uttermost ends of the earth flow sombre under an overcast sky. Leading into the heart of an immense darkness.<br><br><strong><em>The Pyramid</em> (2014), directed by Grégory Levasseur , is distributed in UK cinemas by Twentieth Century Fox, Certificate 15.</strong></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best Films of 2014]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our first ever Reel Opinions where we talk about the best films of 2014.]]></description><link>http://reelopinions.com/best-films-of-2014/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__60299fc72df188001c75fe8a</guid><category><![CDATA[Review]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lists]]></category><category><![CDATA[Top 10]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Reel Opinions]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 22:10:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hkohga7go/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/maxresdefault1.jpg" alt="Best Films of 2014"/><p>Our first ever Reel Opinions where we talk about the best films of 2014.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFs2xxrRtxE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""/></figure>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

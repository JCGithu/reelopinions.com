There's only a few\nquestions just because we had limited time and there was translation back and\nforth. But yeah, give it a read if you're interested in more.\n\nMary the Witch's Flower is the first film by Studio Ponoc; meaning \"midnight\" or\n\"a brand new day\" as a majority are staff that have left Studio Ghibli to start\ntheir own company. Yonebayashi, the director, he originally did ‘When Marnie Was\nThere’ and ‘The Secret Life of Arietty’, and basically when Studio Ghibli\nstarted shutting now and it’s masters announced they were no longer producing\nfeature films, its younger staff thought: \"Well... We still want to do stuff.\nWe'd like to have jobs\" and so they have set off on their own ways.\n\nThere is a quote from the original book that they cited a lot in a lot of the\ninterview materials  where Mary says at one point: \"I want to open this door but\nI want to open it without using magic no matter how long that takes\" and that is\nkind of how they've cited their mindset going into this film. They wanted a\ncharacter that liked magic, but then realized at the end of it that they no\nlonger needed magic to be who they were. That is the context that they've seen\nfor moving on from the magic of Studio Ghibli.\n\nI understand that concept, however I think that they don't push far enough with\nthis film to be completely separate from the past.\n\nI also think there's something with that statement where you say \"We don't want\nmagic\" – as it’s disregarding that that is the aspect most people like about\nStudio Ghibli? They like that it's got this magical element to it, this fantasy,\nthis wonder, and saying we want to leave the magic of Studio Ghibili behind -- I\nknow that they're  highlighting its reputation moreso than the actual style of\nthe films, because this is very much a continuation of that. But it's a\ntouchstone that I think highlights a few of the flaws going into the final\nproduct.\n\nMary and the Witch's Flower is based on the English novel The Little Broomstick.\nMary has moved to live with her elderly aunt in the countryside and it's summer\nso she's just waiting to start school in this new area. So she's left in the\nhouse with just elderly people and nothing to really do and so she's very bored\nand she slowly starts exploring the nearby countryside. While doing that she\nfollows some cats finds the magical witch's flower and a broomstick. By crushing\none of the flower’s berries she gains magical powers for those 24 hours and the\nbroom sets off and takes her away to Endor College where she finds a magical\nheadmistress and plots happens, as it tends to do sometimes.\n\nAs films go it's not particularly flawed in any way, it's just missing that\nmagic that they wanted to kind of step away from. Mary feels like a compilation\nof all the kind of stubborn Ghibili girls rolled into one, but with nothing in\nparticular defining her. It's also a very similar plot of being whisked away to\na magical building run by a kind of creepy crony old woman who uses magic to\ncontrol the girl at several times and it ultimately wraps into a story of\nTechnology versus nature. So to say this is a film that is entirely branching\nout from what's happened before would be… untruthful.\n\nThey have also said in all the promotional materials that they didn't\ndeliberately go out to try and make a film that would be popular and make money\n- they wanted to make something that they wanted to make; and again I think, is\nthat really true? Because, granted, the director’s previous two books that he's\nadapted into films are English fantasy novels by female writers around the same\nera, So that's definitely in his MO, but the past two films were definitely\nsmaller in scale and a lot more focused on human drama and emotions. Whereas\nthis is on a much larger scale and just seems to skim over a lot of the human\nelement of the film.\n\nAs you could probably see in the trailer obviously the animation is just\ntop-notch all the way through. I think they've put a majority of the kind of\nflourishes in the trailer so you've probably already seen it on this video but\nthere are some really amazingly animated sections.\n\nI don't know why I've left off this review so long because I saw it a while ago\nand when I think back to it I just think that there wasn't that much to remember\nabout it. Like I said the characters were kind of cut-out, the plot was... I\nwouldn't venture to say predictable but it wasn't particularly imaginative and\nthe moments where the film was being imaginative it seemed to really brush over\nto get back to a plot that I wasn't that interested in. In all of the interviews\nthey mentioned how passionate they were about this project and I'd watched the\nbehind-the-scenes documentary on the amount of work that they did put into it\nand the amount of late nights - but watching the final film you don't feel that.\nYou don't feel the passion.\n\nYou don't feel like this is a story that he really wants to tell. It feels like\nthe story that the studio wants to tell to get a really good first start and I\ncan understand that because starting a studio, especially a high quality\nanimation feature film studio, is just--  it's a very very risky move. It just\nis. I'm not saying that they don't love animation, obviously they love animation\nthat's why they are wanting to make this, but they need to set a good foundation\nfor that company and I completely understand that but I just think that it means\nthat whatever Ponoc come out with next potentially, or maybe the film after\nthat, if they continue to be successful I just think that this will be looked\nback on as the safe foundation from which they tried to build something new.\n\nI can't hate the film for that. But it doesn't mean I have to love it or\nparticularly like it. I don't think there was much to watch back on. I think\nthat if you maybe have a kid, they might enjoy it. Just a kid that loves fantasy\nin particular But for adults--  like adults can re-watch a lot of the classic\nGhibili films and still feel that wonder of it and the fun.

Oh damn, found footage, he had forgot. Had he made this error more than\nonce? Days were starting to blur together, nothing was certain anymore. The A.D\nasks if this means they’ll have to get rid of that shot where the camera tracks\nup into space and looks down on earth. So he had forgotten before. Oh well.\n\n“Are you kidding? That’ll take… effort”.\n\nNo. He has more pressing matters to attend to. The visual effects people are on\nthe phone asking if he really wants his monsters to look like the rabbit\ncreatures from the 2002 Scooby Doo movie. Amateurs. Why can’t they understand\nhis dream? Out here, a man has to come to terms with who he really is. Who is\nLevasseur? A visionary. They might not see that now. But they will. They will.\nHe looks up to the sky. There are no clouds. Just the vast expanse of infinite\nspace. No one to tell them what to do. Here everything plays by his rules. He\nreturns his gaze down, walks onto set.\n\nLet’s just get this over with.

They’d got through it so far without worrying about it. No. His mind was elsewhere. For a start, he’s on the final day of shooting and has yet to acquire a script. So far he and the crew have been working with some crayon jottings they found on a napkin at a Burger King. “It’ll do” he shrugged when setting up the camera on day one, and it had been the production ethos ever since. But maybe now was the time to make a change. Dialogue such as “We’re like food in a bowl” and “Can you stop being Archaeologists for 5 minutes and act like human beings!?” can only get you so far.<br><br>He mulls on this thought.

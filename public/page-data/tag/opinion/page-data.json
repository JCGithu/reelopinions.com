If I were to\nask you what underlying factor links together those films, how would you\nrespond? Aside from by saying that they’re all distinctly mediocre or outright\nterrible. Granted that is a very salient point, but there’s something more\nspecific unifying this miserable bunch.\n\nIndeed, the true commonality here is that each of these limp releases was\ninfamously neutered by their respective studios, all for the sake of lowering\nthe MPAA rating. With conspicuously absent violence and embarrassingly-censored\nlanguage, these sanitized misfires all fell completely flat. This is because\nthey were forced to sacrifice their integrity at the altar of an ill-fitting\nPG-13 certificate.\n\nYou may recall a time when this undignified fate was imposed upon most\nblockbusters. After all, it used to be standard practice for the industry to\nwater down explicitly mature properties, in order to make them more palatable to\nyounger viewers. This was especially true around the turn of the millennium,\nwhen Hollywood inexplicably convinced itself that R-ratings were no longer\nprofitable and so turned its back on them altogether.\n\nThis arbitrary mindset lead to studios sabotaging their own products, so that\nthey could appeal to a broader audience and maximise ticket sales. There was a\nsubsequent pandemic of lameness, with iconic horrors being reduced to tame,\nbloodless affairs (The Fog) and action flicks transforming into timid shadows of\ntheir former selves (Taken 2).\n\nFans were naturally opposed to the trend and yearned for the halcyon days of\nhigh body-counts, graphic decapitations and liberally deployed F-bombs. But it\nwasn’t just the ‘’basement dwellers’’ complaining either, as slowly-but-surely\neveryone became sick of the dreaded ‘’PG-13-ification’’. This fatigue extended\nfrom the general public, to professional reviewers and even filmmakers\nthemselves, who felt like they were being routinely hamstrung.\n\nThe Triumphant R-Resurgence\n\nHowever, you’ve probably noticed a dramatic shift occurring in the last few\nyears, with the pendulum swinging in the other direction entirely. Now, studios\ncan’t get enough of R-ratings and are trying to cram as much NSFW content into\ntheir releases as humanly possible. They’re even going so far as to commission\nreshoots\n[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/03/fox-could-be-overhauling-the-new-mutants-reshooting-nearly-fifty-percent-of-the-film/] \nand alternative cuts\n[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2016/06/blu-ray-review-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-ultimate-edition-2016/]\n, all with the express purpose of bumping up the certificate. It’s like they’ve\ndone a complete 180!\n\nThis seismic change can largely be attributed to the earth-shattering success of \nDeadpool, the plucky underdog that surpassed all box-office expectations back in\n2016. Indeed, off the back of the watershed hit, Hollywood has been\n(re)convinced that ‘’mature’’ films can be commercially viable. By extension,\nthe potty-mouthed sensation has almost single-handedly ushered in a new era of\nR-rated supremacy and everybody wants a piece of the action.\n\nAs a result, the industry is currently in the midst of a veritable frenzy, with\nstudios going out of their way to find any edgy or risque franchises to call\ntheir own. In fact, the R-rating has now become a badge of honour among movies:\none that is synonymous with cool; fun; and daringness. In comparison, having a\nPG-13 just makes you look kind of stuffy and behind-the-times.\n\nHistory Repeats Itself\n\nAs one of those whiners who spent years lamenting the ostracism of the R-rating,\nI can attest that this transition has been vindicating. What’s more, some truly\nfantastic films have spawned from the mania, ones that would have otherwise been\nunthinkable, like the recent It adaptation and Logan.\n\nStill, it would be naive to think that studios have learned their lesson. Sure,\nthey’ve gleaned something from the merc-with-a-mouth’s lucrative performance,\nyet the conclusion they’ve arrived at is typically misguided and simplistic.\nThey should have realised the value of taking risks and of placing greater\nconfidence in their filmmakers. They should have seen the error of their ways\nand resolved to no longer tamper with art. But instead, they are now under the\nimpression that an R-rating is the be-all-and-end-all and that gore, nudity, or\nprofanity will automatically make their films more popular. Which is why they’re\nnow trying to compel their productions into meeting this criteria.\n\nBecause make no mistake, they’re still interfering with movies and feebly trying\nto contrive ways of second-guessing the market. The only difference is that\nthey’re now doing it in the inverse direction and want everything to be\n‘’hardcore’’, irrespective of whether it makes any goddamn sense! I mean, just\nlook at some of these proposed reimaginings: R-rated Star Trek; R-rated \nTransformers, R-rated Superman! It’s madness.\n\nJust like Alien Vs Predator never suited a PG-13, these properties have\nabsolutely no business adopting a restricted certificate. Having Bumblebee say\n“Fuck” isn’t going to improve things for the Transformers series, it’s just\ngoing to feel awkward and jarring. Likewise, Star Trek is supposed to be a\nhopeful and optimistic vision of the future: one built on notions of tolerance;\nopen-mindedness; and peaceful cohabitation. So to reconfigure the whole thing as\na gritty nightmare about the “Horrors of Space” would be a betrayal of its very\nessence.\n\nIn fact, slapping an out-of-place R over the top of Star Trek will cause just as\nmuch damage as stripping the R away from Die Hard did. The principle remains the\nsame, as the industry is still meddling with its films and is still prioritising\nthose MPAA ratings over their creative instinct.\n\nWhilst having an R might be in vogue right now, that doesn’t negate the fact\nthat each movie needs to be assessed on its own terms! Some, like Star Wars or \nSpider-Man, ought to be suitable for consumption by anyone. They’re innocent\nadventure stories and need to have a lighter feel that’s in keeping with that\ntone. Contrastingly, things like The Raid, John Wick, or Kingsman absolutely\nrely on being able to push the boat out and so need the flexibility that a\nhigher certificate provides.\n\nThe thing is, producers should be able to easily identify which of their\nproperties fall into which camp. Yet they have repeatedly demonstrated that they\nare incapable of making these judgements sensibly. First they thought that a \nRobocop remake would be worthwhile without the blood, and now they seem to think\nthat the key to salvaging Transformers is to have Optimus Prime orchestrate a\ngang-bang or something. Frankly, if a person believes that such a franchise\n(which let me remind you, is based on a toyline) would benefit from an R-rating,\nthen they’re probably not the right person to be helming that particular\nproject. Honestly, the situation is getting out of hand. And should things carry\non in this vein, then R-mania is going to have just as many casualties as\nPG-13-ification ever did.\n\nR-Ratings Are Not a Magic Fix\n\nOf course, we all know this isn’t really about the improving quality of films.\nNo, if an adult Transformers ever does materialise, then it won’t be a\ncreatively-motivated decision. On the contrary, it’ll be the result of some\ncynical executive sticking their nose in and deciding that such a venture would\nincrease their profit margins. Why? Because Rs are the “in thing” right now and\nthere’s no artistic justification beyond that.\n\nSpeaking of which, does anyone else feel like these transparent attempts to ride\non Deadpool’s coattails are becoming increasingly desperate? Look at The\nHappytime Murders. Its marketing was wholly dependent upon the viewer being\nattracted to lazy dick jokes and other tired, raunchy gags. The fact that they\ndidn’t shown anything especially funny was presumably irrelevant, because it was\nR and that was meant to be enough. It’s all the trailer had to work with and it\nmilked that selling point for every last drop, practically screaming “Look,\nwe’re edgy! We’ve got swearing! Please like us!”\n\nWorse still, a lot of people seem to be drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. You\ncan already see pundits getting carried away, placing far too much weight on the\nintrinsic merit of an R, as if they expect it to inherently lead to better\nmovies. For instance, there’s a staggering amount of articles out there\nsuggesting that Venom’s fate ultimately hinged on whether it would attain a\nrestricted certificate, like that alone would have made the difference between\nit being a bad or good film. Likewise, The Predator was swept up in a similar\ndiscussion and when we all discovered that it actually was going to be an R,\nthen the delirious excitement this generated ended up overshadowing the more\nimportant things: like the troubling behind the scenes rumours and the\nwell-documented reshoots. Even decade-old movies are now being roped into the\ndiscussion, with Nic Cage positing that Ghost Rider would have been more\nbearable had it only\nbeen an R\n[https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/04/nicolas-cage-wants-r-rated-ghost-rider-someone-else-part/] \n(I suppose that’d be true if you ignore the bad screenwriting, lackluster\ndirection and poor VFX).\n\nBut in the end a certificate couldn’t save Venom, nor would it have ever rescued \nGhost Rider. For adult content alone is not enough to centre a movie on.\nAdmittedly, when used well things like violence can complement a film, but in\nthese instances it’s just the icing on the cake. Now that might seem obvious to\nyou, but it’s a lesson that the industry could do with internalising. After all,\nas long as they continue to steer films into specific ratings (be it G, PG-13,\nor R), then they are just shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nObviously there are some caveats to this. Like if Paul King wanted to open \nPandington 3 with unsimulated oral sex, then it would probably be wise for\nsomeone to intervene. But unless directors intend on doing something that\nblatantly inappropriate (you know, like a fucking R-rated Star Trek), then\nproducers should simply let the creative process take its natural course.\nBecause ratings need to be earned organically and more importantly, they should\nalways be the end-result of unfettered artistic decisions.
